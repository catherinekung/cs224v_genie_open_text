Review: "I ordered the food from GrubHub. Was suprised at how quickly it arrived and the food was still piping hot! Loved the chicken masala, was tender and juicy. The lassi we ordered was a bit too sweet for my liking, but was still a perfect dessert to end our meal with. Next time, will try dining in at the restaurant to get a feel for the vibes." \n

Review: "I ordered their butter lamb curry and lamb tikka masala with a side of naan and basmati rice for both via DoorDash. For the $52 I paid (which does not include the DoorDash fee or dasher tip, bringing it to $76), I was incredibly disappointed. The tikka masala and the butter chicken tasted mostly the same, neither being particularly appetizing. Also, the amount paid for the quantity and quality of food that arrived was completely disproportionate. For much better quality food, I highly recommend Rangoli on Union and Woodard." \n
