This Weinerschnitzle location has always been my favorite due to the location, staff, and then there's the one of a kind menu! They make their fries to order so you won't be getting limp, lifeless, cool fries. No, you get smokin hot French fries to go with that smokin hot Chilli cheese dog! Five stars, can't miss, I gotta have it once a week!","*They make their fries to order so you won't be getting limp, lifeless, cool fries. *you get smokin hot French fries to go with that smokin hot Chilli cheese dog!",* Fries are made to order * Hot and crispy fries,

2,"This is the closest Weinerschnitzel location to me. The food is doable on certain days and it's a complete miss on others.  Quality control and quality as a whole is nonexistent so come here at your own risk.  The only item I come here for are the Chili Cheese Fries and my cravings usually aren't satisfied. There is usually at least one issue regarding stale fries, unmelted cheese, and|or the orders are made half a**.  FYI- keep an eye out for coupons in the mail. The food isn't worth paying full price!!","*The food is doable on certain days and it's a complete miss on others *Quality control and quality as a whole is nonexistent *usually at least one issue regarding stale fries, unmelted cheese, and|or the orders are made half a**.","* Inconsistent food quality * Lack of quality control * Common issues with stale fries, unmelted cheese and incomplete orders", 
3,Don't order the pretzel bun dog with cheese. You get a pretzel bun and a side of cheese no dog. Been ordering this for years. First time I've had no dog in it. Went back through the drive thru only to be told we got what we ordered a pretzel bun with cheese. Ummm no I ordered a pretzel bun DOG with cheese. Then opened the cheese only to have plastic in it.

4,"Only good thing bout this place is the milkshakes! Please don't waste your money on the chili cheese fries/burgers/hotdogs, after taste, tastes like it's been placed in dirty water. The fries was not crispy or cooked, the chili tasted watered down, & the cheese was like plastic. Good customer service tho","*Only good thing bout this place is the milkshakes! *the chili cheese fries/burgers/hotdogs, after taste, tastes like it's been placed in dirty water *The fries was not crispy or cooked *the chili tasted watered down *the cheese was like plastic.",* Milkshakes are the only good thing * Unpleasant aftertaste for chili cheese fries/burgers/hotdogs * Fries were not crispy or cooked well * Chili tasted watered down and cheese tasted like plastic,

6,"Kinda sucks that this is the closest Weinerschnitzel to where i'm currently living at.  I've been coming here on and off for years.  Over the years the pricing has gone up and the quality has gone down.  I used to come here regularly (about 4x / month) and got to know the workers and assistant managers.  It was to the point where they would hook me up with coupon prices even if I didnt have the coupon.     Nowadays, if you dont have a coupon, you're paying full price.  And like the previous Yelper said, the food is not worth paying full price for.",*the quality has gone down *the food is not worth paying full price for,* Decrease in quality * Food not worth full price, 
7,"I found two transparent white black larvae floating around my later soda cup filled with lemonade many hours ago. The first one I found was when I filled my second cup at the soda machine, so I dumped it out and refilled it again but when I got to school at around 2:45 PM. I found another thinner transparent white black floating around my lemonade drink so I dumped it out again, please consider having a soda machine repairs man to come by and clean the machine. It can be very hazardous! But overall the food is very good, as always.","*overall the food is very good, as always.",* Food is consistently good, 
8,"I guess compared to the other reviews I got lucky today. I ordered a corndog, small fries, and Mug rootbeer. Ordering was quick and efficient. The corndog was fresh tasting. The cornbread coating was slightly sweet with distinct corn taste. The hotdog had a slight snap to it as I bit into it. Overall I was pleased with my corndog experience. The fries were awesome. Very hot, and slightly crispy. They were not oily, and reminded me of Micky D's back in the day when they could make killer fries. The rootbeer was cold, crisp, and refreshing. I took this snack to go so I can't really comment on dining in. I was happy with my choices and would choose to do this again.","*The corndog was fresh tasting *The cornbread coating was slightly sweet with distinct corn taste *The hotdog had a slight snap to it as I bit into it *The fries were awesome, very hot, and slightly crispy *They were not oily and reminded me of Micky D's back in the day when they could make killer fries *The rootbeer was cold, crisp, and refreshing.","* Fresh corndog with slightly sweet cornbread coating * Hotdog had a slight snap * Awesome, hot and slightly crispy fries * Rootbeer was cold, crisp and refreshing.",

10, , , ,"The reviews about the food at Weinerschnitzel are mixed as well. Some customers have praised the hot and crispy fries that are made to order. On the other hand, there are also many complaints about inconsistent food quality, lack of quality control and common issues with stale fries, unmelted cheese and incomplete orders. Some even describe the experience as terrible due to plastic in the cheese and unpleasant aftertaste for chili cheese fries/burgers/hotdogs. In contrast, some reviews praise the fresh corndog with slightly sweet cornbread coating and the hotdog that had a slight snap. Additionally, customers appreciated the awesome, hot and slightly crispy fries and the cold, crisp and refreshing root beer. Overall, it seems that there are both positive and negative reviews, but many customers have experienced a decrease in quality and do not feel that the food is worth the full price."
