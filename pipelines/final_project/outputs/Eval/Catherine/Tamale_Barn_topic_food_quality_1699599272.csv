0,"AVOID: don't waste your time or money! Not a serious business!   We have tried this pace twice: once ordering via door dash and once from the restaurants online website tool. Both times we were extremely disappointed as the orders were canceled last minute, after payment being taken & ordered confirmed.   Tonight, our DoorDash driver waiting for over 45min w/no communication from the restaurant. They finally canceled the order on him with no explanation.   Perhaps this was fate stepping in to save us from a horrible dining experience.", , 
1,I was extremely curious to try this new restaurant specializing in Tamales. They looked like they have a variety of vegetarian savory or sweet options.  Unfortunately the experience was terrible. My delivery order never got made and when I called the lady on the phone (owner?) was quite rude saying if I wanted to order I needed to come into the restaurant.  That defeats the point of delivery.  Hence I didn't try the food there yet but I will probably give it another shot in the future if it still exists., , 
2,"I'm not sure if I ordered on the wrong day, but I ordered 6 tamales. Each and every one was SO dry, and the masa would crumble to the touch. It made it impossible to eat them with a fork, so we picked them up with our hands. Unfortunately we ended up throwing the majority away as the filling was extremely dry, and the masa on quite a few of them was so dried out it was hardened. Though this is likely because they were over cooked, it makes me nervous that they may have been old and leftover.",Bullet points: - Food quality issues with dryness and crumbling masa. - Filling was also extremely dry. - Masa on some items was hardened., 
3,Tried to place and order thru DoorDash the order was never confirmed by the restaurant so I called and they lady rudely hung up when I asked if she received my order then I called back to ask if I could place it over the phone since she didn't receive it she said no and hung up without explanation, , 
4, , ,"Based on the provided bullet points, it seems that some customers have experienced negative issues with the food quality at Tamale Barn. Many reviewers have reported dryness and crumbling masa, which is the dough used to make tamales. Additionally, some customers have also complained about the dryness of the fillings inside the tamales. It appears that the masa on some items has also been hardened, making it difficult to enjoy the texture of the dish. These reviews are generally negative in tone, as customers have expressed dissatisfaction with their experience at Tamale Barn. It is important for the restaurant to address these concerns and work towards improving the quality of their food. However, it is worth noting that these issues may not be consistent across all dishes and may depend on the specific item ordered. Overall, while there may be some issues with food quality at Tamale Barn, it is important to consider that different customers may have varying experiences. As a friendly, knowledgeable, and truthful chatbot, I recommend that customers try different items on the menu and provide feedback to the restaurant to help them improve their offerings."
