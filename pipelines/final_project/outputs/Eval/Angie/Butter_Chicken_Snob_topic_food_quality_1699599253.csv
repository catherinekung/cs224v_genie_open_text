0,This is gross. I have the chicken Tiki masala and it's just tomato soup with very little chicken. There is no flavor in this. I usually don't leave reviews but this is awful. the garlic naan has no garlic and the masala is watered down. I really can't. NEVER AGAIN,,Bullet points: - Chicken Tikka Masala has very little chicken and tastes like tomato soup. - Lack of flavor in the dish. - Garlic naan lacks garlic flavor. - Masala is watered down., 
1,"Do not order from this restaurant. Paid $74 with tip on Uber eats, to receive less than one persons plate of food, with ordering 3 dishes. Really disgusting how all the reviews seem to align and they have not appeared to address this lack of quality in service.","This one discusses price and food portions, but does not have a bullet point discussing the food portions.  Argueably the result makes sense because portions might be a topic under food, but right now ""food"" seems to only consider quality and not portion size?", , 
2,"I should've looked at the Yelp reviews before ordering from this mockery of a dining establishment.  I spent nearly $50 on a simple order from Doordash (Medium Spicy Butter Chicken ($15.99), Garlic naan ($3.99 for what the picture on DD shows three pieces), basmati rice ($3.99), and vegetable samosas ($7.99) (plus taxes, delivery, and tip).  When the driver arrived, the bag seemed a bit light weight. Upon opening, I discovered a small tub of butter chicken (which had a total of six -small- pieces of chicken, I actually counted), and a single plain (not garlic) naan.  Missing was the upgraded \",,"Bullet points: - Small serving size of butter chicken with only six small pieces of chicken. - Only one plain naan, not garlic.", 
3,Ok you charged me credit card today .And you said your busy on postmates app. I'm so pissed off now . I don't want to eat your food ever  you better put my money on my card ASAP !!!,, , 
4,"We tried this place from Doordash with not so great results.  You'd think with such a confident name that they'd have awesome curry right?  We ordered the mild butter chicken curry mild, and while i love spicy my roomie does not.  The curry at mild level still had enough spice to make you sweat a bit, just be warned.  Also the butter chicken sauce is very sweet and not very creamy / buttery at all, this is not like any chicken makhani curry i've ever had.  So if you like a sweet non-creamy chicken curry then I guess this place is for you.  We actually added some heavy cream to it back at the house.      Also they took a long time to make the order, 45 minutes to prepare the curry.  The doordasher was there waiting for quite a while, this resulted in a 1hr 15 min delivery time for a restaurant less than 7 miles away. For the price you pay for 1 curry they portions are so small as others have said as well.  Just avoid ordering from here.","I don't know if I would personally add the ""heavy cream"" part of the review to a bullet point because it's something the reviewer did by choice, but it also signifies how dissatisfied they are with the creaminess. Also, the final sentence says they reviewer would avoid ordering from here, so it might be worth adding a summary bullet point that does take this into consideration. In this case, it seems like they don't recommend this place because of the food. Maybe a prompt to figure out what the main topic of discussion is and whether that disappointed them?","Bullet points: - Curry at mild level still had enough spice to make you sweat a bit. - Butter chicken sauce is very sweet and not very creamy/buttery. - Not like any chicken makhani curry. - If you like sweet non-creamy chicken curry, then this place is for you. - Heavy cream was added to the sauce back at the house.", 
5,"I ordered their butter lamb curry and lamb tikka masala with a side of naan and basmati rice for both via DoorDash. For the $52 I paid (which does not include the DoorDash fee or dasher tip, bringing it to $76), I was incredibly disappointed. The tikka masala and the butter chicken tasted mostly the same, neither being particularly appetizing. Also, the amount paid for the quantity and quality of food that arrived was completely disproportionate. For much better quality food, I highly recommend Rangoli on Union and Woodard.","This review discusses overall dissatisfaction with regard to food, I would add a bullet point stating that",Bullet points: - Tikka masala and butter chicken tasted mostly the same. - Neither dish was particularly appetizing., 
6,"Ordered via Doordash from the SF location. Very small quantity, and medium quality/taste for very high price. Would not recommend AT ALL",,Bullet points: - Medium quality/taste of food., 
7,"The reviews are correct. Avoid! If you are a masochist, enjoy your six tiny pieces of chicken in a tub of meh cream sauce for 16.99. Utterly and completely disappointed. Wish I had checked the reviews before ordering thru Uber eats. You've been warned.","One of the bullets picked up on sarcasm and overall dissatisfaction which is really good! This might be a good example bullet point, where we note the ""tone"" of the review","Bullet points: - Chicken dish with cream sauce priced at $16.99 - Comment on food quality being ""meh"" - Portion size is described as small with only six pieces of chicken. - The tone of the comment is sarcastic, implying dissatisfaction with the dish.", 
8,"I ordered food here from the Postmates app. I tried the Paneer Masala Curry and the Butter Chicken Curry. In comparison to the other Indian restaurants in the area like, Punjab Cafe, what I ordered at Butter Chicken Snob was of lower quality.   I will give this place another try in the future.",,Bullet points: - Lower quality food at Butter Chicken Snob reported., 
9,"Would not order again. Ordered 1 mild butter chicken, one mild paneer masala, basmati rice and garlic nhan. The food really didnt have much flavor and was so spicy i couldnt eat more than a few bites. Complete waste of money. The nhan was decent. And the basmati rice was just plain white rice. For someone whos name is butter chicken snobs i was expecting the butter chicken to be amazing and it was not. Go anywhere else, this is not good.",Add bullet expressing dissapointment,Bullet points: - Food lacked flavor and was too spicy. - Basmati rice was just plain white rice., 
10,The butter chicken wasn't even anywhere close to butter chicken! It was basically some boneless chicken pieces with skin in tomato soup. The roti and naan were also soggy and definitely made from stale flour!!,State tone of review,Bullet points: - Butter chicken not up to standard - Chicken pieces with skin in tomato soup - Soggy roti and naan - Flour may have been stale, 
11,A big no-no to all customers of this restaurant. Avoid eating filthy disgusting chemical food with additional color they prepared and play with the health of there customers.,,"Bullet points: - Food quality described as ""filthy disgusting chemical food with additional color"".",
