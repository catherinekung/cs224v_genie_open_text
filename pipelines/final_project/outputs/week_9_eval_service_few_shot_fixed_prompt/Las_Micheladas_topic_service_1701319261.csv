0,"This is a straight up bar bar with 2 billiard tables, so it's not a chill and kick it type of vibe. It's a low key sports bar nothing more nothing less. I was expecting just that and got what I was expecting. The only thing though is that it's cash only but other then that it's legit to sit down and drink a lil bit before the next bar hop.",No relevant information found., , ,

3,"Guys if your planning to take a date out to a bar, this is so not the place. This is more of a guys who just got out from work and want a couple of beers type of bar. Ladies, Ive been here once with my girls and it was a big no no, weird guys hitting you up, all up in your face. One time this guy gave my cousin a paleta de payaso, wtf lol. I decided to give it another try with my boyfriend and still no good for me. One of the servers was rude, we asked her to bring us a bucket of beers that took her almost 20 minutes for her to bring since she was flirting with a group of guys that were behind us drinking of their own beer. So I turn around and tell her \",*One of the servers was rude *Took almost 20 minutes to bring a bucket of beers *She was flirting with a group of guys instead of attending to us,* Rude server * Long wait time for beer * Server was more interested in flirting with another group, ,

Some reviewers have had a great experience with attentive servers who frequently checked on them. On the other hand, some have mentioned a rude server, long wait time for drinks, and a server who was more interested in flirting with another group than attending to their needs. Overall, it seems that the service at Las Micheladas is inconsistent, with some customers being very pleased and others being dissatisfied."
