This Weinerschnitzle location has always been my favorite due to the location, staff, and then there's the one of a kind menu! They make their fries to order so you won't be getting limp, lifeless, cool fries. No, you get smokin hot French fries to go with that smokin hot Chilli cheese dog! Five stars, can't miss, I gotta have it once a week!","food quality = ""They make their fries to order so you won't be getting limp, lifeless, cool fries.

1,Mexican lady working drive thru is hella rude. The yelled at me for asking for a water cup. She demanded a tip for the \,,Is there anything I can assist you with?, 
2,"This is the closest Weinerschnitzel location to me. The food is doable on certain days and it's a complete miss on others.  Quality control and quality as a whole is nonexistent so come here at your own risk.  The only item I come here for are the Chili Cheese Fries and my cravings usually aren't satisfied. There is usually at least one issue regarding stale fries, unmelted cheese, and|or the orders are made half a**.  FYI- keep an eye out for coupons in the mail. The food isn't worth paying full price!!","food quality = [""The food is doable on certain days and it's a complete miss on others."", ""The only item I come here for are the Chili Cheese Fries and my cravings usually aren't satisfied."", ""There is usually at least one issue regarding stale fries, unmelted cheese, and|or the orders are made half a**.""","* Inconsistent food quality * Chili Cheese Fries are good, but other cravings are not satisfied * Frequent issues with stale fries, unmelted cheese and incomplete orders", 
3,Don't order the pretzel bun dog with cheese. You get a pretzel bun and a side of cheese no dog. Been ordering this for years. First time I've had no dog in it. Went back through the drive thru only to be told we got what we ordered a pretzel bun with cheese. Ummm no I ordered a pretzel bun DOG with cheese. Then opened the cheese only to have plastic in it.

4,"Only good thing bout this place is the milkshakes! Please don't waste your money on the chili cheese fries/burgers/hotdogs, after taste, tastes like it's been placed in dirty water. The fries was not crispy or cooked, the chili tasted watered down, & the cheese was like plastic. Good customer service tho","food quality = [""Please don't waste your money on the chili cheese fries/burgers/hotdogs, after taste, tastes like it's been placed in dirty water."", ""The fries was not crispy or cooked, the chili tasted watered down, & the cheese was like plastic.""","* Poor food quality, specifically chili cheese fries, burgers, and hotdogs * Fries were not crispy or cooked properly * Chili tasted watered down and cheese had a plastic-like texture",

6,"Kinda sucks that this is the closest Weinerschnitzel to where i'm currently living at.  I've been coming here on and off for years.  Over the years the pricing has gone up and the quality has gone down.  I used to come here regularly (about 4x / month) and got to know the workers and assistant managers.  It was to the point where they would hook me up with coupon prices even if I didnt have the coupon.     Nowadays, if you dont have a coupon, you're paying full price.  And like the previous Yelper said, the food is not worth paying full price for.","food quality = ""the food is not worth paying full price for.""",* Poor food quality * Not worth paying full price for, 
7,"I found two transparent white black larvae floating around my later soda cup filled with lemonade many hours ago. The first one I found was when I filled my second cup at the soda machine, so I dumped it out and refilled it again but when I got to school at around 2:45 PM. I found another thinner transparent white black floating around my lemonade drink so I dumped it out again, please consider having a soda machine repairs man to come by and clean the machine. It can be very hazardous! But overall the food is very good, as always.","food quality = overall the food is very good, as always.",* Good quality food, 
8,"I guess compared to the other reviews I got lucky today. I ordered a corndog, small fries, and Mug rootbeer. Ordering was quick and efficient. The corndog was fresh tasting. The cornbread coating was slightly sweet with distinct corn taste. The hotdog had a slight snap to it as I bit into it. Overall I was pleased with my corndog experience. The fries were awesome. Very hot, and slightly crispy. They were not oily, and reminded me of Micky D's back in the day when they could make killer fries. The rootbeer was cold, crisp, and refreshing. I took this snack to go so I can't really comment on dining in. I was happy with my choices and would choose to do this again.","food quality = ""The corndog was fresh tasting.

There were frequent complaints about stale fries, unmelted cheese, and incomplete orders.

Some have even expressed that the food is not worth paying full price for. On a positive note, one review praised the corndog with its fresh, sweet cornbread coating and tasty hotdog. The fries were also mentioned to be delicious - hot, slightly crispy, and not oily. Overall, it seems like the food quality is inconsistent and some items are not up to par."
