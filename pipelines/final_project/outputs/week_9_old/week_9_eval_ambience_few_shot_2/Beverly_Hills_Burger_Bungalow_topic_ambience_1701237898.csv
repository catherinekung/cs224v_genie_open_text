0,Disgusting. Ordered on Uber eats and it was awful quality of food . The chicken was PINK still. You can also tell they use nasty oil (and probably don't clean the oil) to fry everything in. I didn't even finish eating it even though I was starving. I am not a picky eater either. DO NOT EAT HERE, , 
1,Disgusting!!! Do not eat here. Ordered on doordash. Not even one star. Chicken was pink still and not crispy or spicy at all. Disgusting. Also fries are like 5 dollars extra and they only serve you a few fries. Not worth spending your money or risking your health!!, , 
2,"Food was ordered through door dash and just the worst! Fried chicken sandwich was cold, the chicken was smashed way too thin and had too much breading. Truly, so awful.", , 
3,"This place is up on door dash, I don't even know if it's the same place but, if it is, it's fake. Just ordered the vegan burger, and when I took a bite, it tasted like real meat. Lo and behold, it was real f-cking meat. Absolutely disgusting, and extremely disrespectful.  I ordered the vegan burger, i have a diet restriction due to my health, so ive been vegan to accommodate my health. I can't eat real meat, I can't eat dairy, and these wise guys here either don't care, are discriminatory towards vegans, or are just stupid stupid and stupid.  We can sue you for this. Don't be surprised if you get sued.", , 
4,"The food is over-cooked, cold, chewy, unedible.", , 
5,"Nasty...nasty...nasty.  Cold no taste at all.  Onion rings are fried onions not breaded.  The worst food I have had delivered during the pandemic.  I have Lupus I am limited on going out to eat, but you hope trying a new restaurant would be a good experience.  This is not the place.", ,
