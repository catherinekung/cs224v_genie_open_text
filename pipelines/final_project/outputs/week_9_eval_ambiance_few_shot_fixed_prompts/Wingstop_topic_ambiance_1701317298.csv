The interior was clean and organized and the workers were super lively cooking, mixing wings, and singing to the latest Shakira song. Good vibes!  The wings were big, crispy, and tossed in delicious flavors. I got the Spicy Korean Q, Atomic, and Lemon Pepper. The Atomic was super spicy, but flavorful.   The seasoned fries were really dark, under seasoned, and soggy. I had to throw it in the air fryer to crisp it up a little.","*The interior was clean and organized *The workers were super lively cooking, mixing wings, and singing to the latest Shakira song. *Good vibes!","* Clean and organized interior * Lively workers cooking, mixing wings and singing along to music * Good vibes", ,

2,Worst service ever! At lunch time most people have to get back to work. The cashier sat on the phone basically reading the menu and restarting the order over and over because the person on the phone didn't know what they wanted. Never even said I'll be right with you. Another guy left in a huff before I finally did. She was literally still taking the order 5 mins later with a line of people waiting! Do cashiers not know how to say could you please hold and help the line of people in front of her?!? And what's with the Mexican music blasting?? It's not a Mexican restaurant!,*What's with the Mexican music blasting?? It's not a Mexican restaurant!,* Complaint about loud Mexican music playing, , 
3,"I'm pretty happy that there is a wingstop closer to where I live but this place needs some work. Either they're short staff or that they need a bigger kitchen, but they misquote customers on the wait time. Me and my boyfriend placed an order online and it says it would be ready by 15-20 minutes. Once it was 20 minutes, we head there and they said that they are currently working on it. 20 minutes past by, i asked them if it's ready, the guy says 5 more minutes. 25 minutes past and i asked yet if it's ready and they barely gave it to us. It's cool that they apologized and they're doing what they can, and this is one of the better spots out there, but come on.. i shouldn't wait for an hour for some wings. please be more time efficient!!",No relevant information found., , , 
4,"I ordered online one day and went to go pick it up about 10 minutes early. The worker at the front told me to wait 5 minutes which was fine. I went to go sit down and waited for my order. After about 15 minutes of waiting, I noticed none of the workers were doing anything at all.  There were at least 5 people working and most of them were just talking and going through their phone. I'd understand if there were other online orders coming through but the store was not busy at all.  I went up to ask if my order was ready and they told me it's still being prepared. Another 5 minutes go by and I see a pickup order get placed in the to-go order area. I assumed the workers would notify me if that was my order or not since I've been waiting for the past 20+ minutes and I was the only customer in the store that was not already eating. Since they didn't ring me up, I sat down patiently still waiting for my order. 5 more minutes pass and I get up to ask about my order. As it turns out, that order was mine and nobody bothered to check up on me or anything. It doesn't make much sense to me that it took 30+ minutes for these 4+ employees to make a chicken sandwich and some fries.  However, the food was actually good and up to par. The service on the other hand was not great and I hope this location can improve on that.",No relevant information found., , ,

Customers have complimented the clean and organized interior, as well as the lively workers who cook, mix wings, and sing along to music. The overall vibe is described as good. However, one review did mention a complaint about loud Mexican music playing."
