0,"This is a straight up bar bar with 2 billiard tables, so it's not a chill and kick it type of vibe. It's a low key sports bar nothing more nothing less. I was expecting just that and got what I was expecting. The only thing though is that it's cash only but other then that it's legit to sit down and drink a lil bit before the next bar hop.",*It's a low key sports bar nothing more nothing less.,* Low key sports bar, ,

3,"Guys if your planning to take a date out to a bar, this is so not the place. This is more of a guys who just got out from work and want a couple of beers type of bar. Ladies, Ive been here once with my girls and it was a big no no, weird guys hitting you up, all up in your face. One time this guy gave my cousin a paleta de payaso, wtf lol. I decided to give it another try with my boyfriend and still no good for me. One of the servers was rude, we asked her to bring us a bucket of beers that took her almost 20 minutes for her to bring since she was flirting with a group of guys that were behind us drinking of their own beer. So I turn around and tell her \",No relevant information found., , ,

5, , , , ,"Based on the bullet points provided, the ambiance at Las Micheladas seems to be a fun and lively environment, with live music and a good number of tables. It is described as a low key sports bar with great beer and Live Banda music. However, it can get hot at times, and it's not recommended for a romantic date. It is more suited for after-work drinks with male friends. Overall, it seems like a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy some live music and drinks."
