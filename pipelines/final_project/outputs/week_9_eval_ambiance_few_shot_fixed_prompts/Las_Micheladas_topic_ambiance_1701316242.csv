I was expecting just that and got what I was expecting. The only thing though is that it's cash only but other then that it's legit to sit down and drink a lil bit before the next bar hop.",*It's a low key sports bar.,* Casual sports bar,

3,"Guys if your planning to take a date out to a bar, this is so not the place. This is more of a guys who just got out from work and want a couple of beers type of bar. Ladies, Ive been here once with my girls and it was a big no no, weird guys hitting you up, all up in your face. One time this guy gave my cousin a paleta de payaso, wtf lol. I decided to give it another try with my boyfriend and still no good for me. One of the servers was rude, we asked her to bring us a bucket of beers that took her almost 20 minutes for her to bring since she was flirting with a group of guys that were behind us drinking of their own beer. So I turn around and tell her \",No relevant information found., ,

5, , , ,"Based on the bullet points provided, it seems that the ambiance at Las Micheladas is generally positive. The casual sports bar atmosphere seems to be well received, with live music adding to the fun atmosphere. There are plenty of tables available, but it can get hot inside the restaurant. Live Banda music is also a highlight, with great beer selection. This restaurant is recommended for after work drinks with friends, however, it is not suggested for a romantic date spot. Overall, it seems like Las Micheladas has a lively and enjoyable atmosphere."
