3,"We saw this place have its grand opening on Facebook, and The city Mayor (Mayor Larry Klein) recommended this place on his Facebook page!! So we wanted to support a small business and we tried it!! We NEVER WRITE REVIEWS (we only have like 4 Facebook reviews and YELP reviews) but I had to share what happened with our food. Just incase somebody else had this happen to their food order.   Bottom line: WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING AGAIN! We ordered one order of each of the following items:  *mixed vegetable chow mein noodles *chicken chow mein noodles  *Vegetable fried rice  *one order of the Chicken tiki masala  (The chicken tiki masala was the BEST thing that was actually good and it was a nice smooth spicy flavor too and very fresh) but the rest was ZERO STARS!! And if I can give the chicken tiki masala 3 stars I would!! but this review is for the whole entire order:   So we ordered Take out, we were tired and wanted to eat at home. So we took the food home and guess what?!  We were eating the noodles and we serve it and we find 4 to 5 inch piece of plastic inside the chow mein noodles!!it looked like a small piece of rubber band maybe about 4 inches or 5 inches long (small rubber band) and we live about 10 minutes from this place, we live near the AMC MOVIE THEATERS in downtown Sunnyvale, so we did not want to drive all the way back to Duane avenue and request a refund so instead we had to dispose all the chow mein noodles. We only ate the chicken tiki masala and the vegetable fried rice. And those were good fresh and delicious. But the noodles we had to throw in the garbage.  For the price that we paid (around 14$ per order for the noodles) this should NEVER happen and also this place seems to be more on the Indian side of the cuisine flavors. Just an FYI this place seems to be more Indian style food (not really the Asian style you expect) and that is okay nothing wrong with Indian food, but don't expect like real chinese style food that you're used to here in America (it's not like the Panda Express style chow mein) this chow mein is more like Indian style chow mein noodles... the way they cook the chow mein noodles here at this restaurant is more heavy with the Indian style cuisine. You can tell with all of the spices and the smell that it's more Indian style type of a food place.   The only GOOD thing that we ate was the order of the chicken tiki masala. But the rest of the food we threw it away - that Piece of long rubber really did leave us without an appetite!! and we will not be coming back ever again, it's as simple as that. Thank you.

4,"Have ordered veg momo and chicken chow mein the first time I went there. After  eating veg momo there, we have gone 3 more times just to eat the yummy veg Momos. Veg Chow mein was amazing and had a lot more vegetables to make it even more yummy.  The ambience inside is amazing which adds up to the amazing eating experience nicely.",*The ambience inside is amazing which adds up to the amazing eating experience nicely.,* Amazing ambiance for a great eating experience, 
5,"New Nepali restaurant in town! We tried momos with soup, chow mein and fried rice. Both the fried rice and chow mein were chock full of vegetables. They are definitely beyond generous with the use of vegetables both in terms of variety and quantity. The veggies were beautifully cooked as well retaining their crunch without being over or under done. I particularly enjoyed the fried rice, the Uber flavorful basmati rice combined with the rich taste of eggs and bountiful vegetables was great. They didn't skimp on the use of vegetables in the chow mein as well. But, the chow mein had a wet and slithery feel to it indicating the noodles did not stay in the pan long enough after dousing it with sauces. They would have greatly benefited with a few extra minutes of cooking.  We got the paneer momos with soup. The soup it came with was delicious but cold/warm. I asked our server about it and apparently it's served cold. Anyway, though the jhol momo was good, it was definitely not the best I had in the bayarea.",No relevant information found., ,
