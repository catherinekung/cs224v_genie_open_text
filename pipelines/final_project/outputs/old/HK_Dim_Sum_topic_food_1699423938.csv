0,"Parking: cramped and crowded. The plaza is very busy so cars are constantly coming in and out. It's in the same plaza as Duc Huong, which gets plenty of customers coming and going.   Front: they have a big banner over the door with their name on it. Can't miss it.   Inside: one line towards the register. It looks like they used to do indoor dining but all the tables are blocked off. Their dim sum items are displayed in glass so it's nice to see what they have. Menu is hung high on the wall. They still have their barriers up which is fine with me.   Service: I haven't been to one of these places in a while so getting yelled at by the Auntie was very nostalgic. I didn't take it personally and no one else should. The uncle was much nicer when he was helping me with the roast duck and pork ears. I do wish the pork ears were sliced thinner but guess no one really has time for that. The Auntie speaks at least three languages: English, Cantonese and Vietnamese.   Food: I would say better than average. Their shumai was huge as were most other items. I ordered quite a few items and everything tasted good. It satisfied the dim sum craving. I am pretty sensitive to overly salty food but eating this, I was fine.   Price: average pricing  Overall, I will definitely be back.   (Ok so the reason why I got yelled at was because  I asked to see the itemized receipt 15 minutes after I had already paid and left. I was waiting for my Duc Huong order and I wasn't able to calculate why my order came out to $63. I thought I got half a duck but it turned out, I got a whole duck, which was what I ordered but I also saw half a duck get hung back up when I was ordering so I got confused. The uncle that helped me remembered that I spoke Chinese so he reminded the Auntie when she was shit talking about me in Chinese. It was pretty funny, I didn't take it personally and I still got what I wanted, the itemized receipt. I checked the boxes when I got back to the car and I did indeed get a whole duck.)",Bullet points= - Better than average food. - Large shumai and other items. - Tasty dishes. - Satisfies dim sum craving. - Not overly salty.,"Positive reviews of HK Dim Sum highlight the better than average food, large shumai and other items, and tasty dishes.

1,"This place is horrible!  Ordered some items on doordash... Cocktail buns - never got them, they substituted with more hot dog buns instead of contacting me or refunding me! Hot dog buns - there was only half a hot dog in the bun so it's 90% bread. This is the first time I've seen a hot dog bun where the hot dog wasn't whole! I get times are hard but what the....  Fried Taro with shrimp/pork - I threw this out, it smelled like ammonia :( which means they either started with pork or shrimp that went bad or they refried and served me old food? Either way I actually had taken a couple of bites of this before noticing it was off? Got a stomach ache a few hours later. Har Gow - only thing that was OK. It gets 1 star for this.   TLDR - SKIP, old rotten food, they're totally skimping! Go anywhere else.","Bullet points= - Hot dog bun: 90% bread, only half a hot dog. - Fried Taro with shrimp/pork: smelled like ammonia, potentially bad ingredients or old food. - Har Gow: acceptable quality.","Positive reviews of HK Dim Sum highlight the better than average food, large shumai and other items, and tasty dishes.

3,I got so much food for what I paid! They literally STUFFED the chow mein into the container until it was packed (only $6 too!) The pan fried chive dumplings were definitely more heavy and dense than the ones I'm used to but they were still tasty. I also had to grab an egg tart for dessert because its must. It was huge! I only took off a star because everything seemed a little extra greasy. But the flavor was there and I definitely recommend this spot if you're craving dimsum on a budget.,"Bullet points= - Chow mein packed in container. - Heavy and dense chive dumplings, still tasty. - Egg tart for dessert, large size. - Food slightly greasy. - Good flavor overall.","Positive reviews of HK Dim Sum highlight the better than average food, large shumai and other items, and tasty dishes.

4,This satisfied my dim sum fix. Not the best but still pretty tasty. Each dim sum piece is hearty. The beef noodle roll was a sub for the prawn one but texture was still good.

5,"This place always seems to satisfy my emergency dim sum cravings! It definitely isnt the best nor do they have the greatest service but they have your regular fixings up until late afternoon!  The siu mai/har gow are large and hearty. Ok in flavor!  The fried items are only good when fresh. I tried random assortments at random times of the day & here is my take. the chinese donuts were quite hard and stale so I do not recommend. The shrimp ball is very large but a little too oily for my liking. Taro ball was ok, lacked flavor. & the turnip cake was almost all cake barely any other texture or flavor but very large. Sesame ball also ok!   They also have combo meals which i thought was very cool! The congee it comes with is not bad either.   They give you packet sauces 2 in 1 combo for to go orders. Labeled for Mandu! So it definitely has a different taste to it, but the chili oil is good and has a neutral flavor  Also have a $15 minimum on card.   All in all it isnt the best, cheapest, or tastiest. But when I get a random craving I seem to always find myself here bc of the variety and convenience.","Bullet points= - Siu mai/har gow: large, hearty, ok flavor. - Fried items: good when fresh. - Chinese donuts: hard, stale, not recommended. - Shrimp ball: large, too oily. - Taro ball: ok, lacks flavor. - Turnip cake: mostly cake, large, limited texture/flavor. - Sesame ball: ok. - Combo meals: available, cool. - Congee: not bad. - Packet sauces: 2 in 1 combo, labeled for Mandu, different taste, good chili oil with neutral flavor.","Positive reviews of HK Dim Sum highlight the better than average food, large shumai and other items, and tasty dishes.

6,"This review is for take-out only. I've ordered delivery from here through DoorDash multiple times and I've been very satisfied with the food each time. The prices are reasonable, the lunch specials are a great deal for a lot of food, and the food has been very good each time I've ordered.   I've been particularly impressed with their barbecue and roast meats. Their meats are much more flavorful and juicy compared to other local take-out dim sum places I've tried. The roast pork and roast duck have been good. The rice rolls are less dense than other places I've tried. Porridges are flavorful and other dim sum items I've tried generally have been delicious.

7,"I don't have to go to Ranch 99 for BBQ meats anymore!  Only thing I dislike is the parking and the area but they accept Visa/MC, offer succulent BBQ pork and roast pork and a limited selections of dim sum such as har gow, shiu mai, rice roll, steamed buns.. all satisfied my stressful Saturday.

8,"Dynasty didn't open until 11 am and I was craving dim sum at 10. My daughter and I were really hungry so we came here to grab some to go. Everything was horrible and a waste of money. Lack of flavor, thickness in some items where it shouldn't be as thick. Peanuts added into certain dishes that do not normally have peanuts was weird.

10,My family was craving dim sum the other day but it was raining really heavy so my bf ordered through door dash. The dim sum here is huge!

11,"Given how expensive dim sum is nowadays, the prices here are more reasonable. You may not get your best dim sum, but it is good enough to satisfy your cravings. As for presentation, you can throw that out the door as well. Don't go thinking you'll find cute dim sum or incredible Instagramable food here.. it's all about bang for your buck and honestly the food is not bad. In fact, i much rather eat here than the dim sum from Sifu Wong Kitchen in santa clara -- knowing that it's cheap, you are NOT going to expect amazing fancy dimsum is more satisfactory than paying $8 for 4 ha gao for just average tasting filling.   Ha gao (shrimp dumpling): skin is SUPER thick i had to peel some of the skin off but the filling is tasty.   the siu mai and all the other items are really big - i have never seen such ginormous Ham Sui Gok (the glutinous football looking thing with filling) before. Though it's a bit too oily but overall the taste is there and it is crispy on the outside, chewy inside and you get a good amount of filling to mochi too. Not just a teaspoon of filling that you may get at a restaurant.   we also really like this fried dumpling with pork, shrimp, and woodear (forgot what it's called, but it's wrapped in wonton skin and deep fried).   the egg tart is a hit or missed. First time i had it was really good, buttery flaky crust with warm jiggly egg custard. The second time, the crust wasn't buttery and was a bit too dry.   Though it's only 3 stars, but yes i will definitely go back to HK dim sum!","Bullet points= - Good dim sum, satisfying cravings. - Ha gao: thick skin, tasty filling. - Siu mai and other items: large size. - Ham Sui Gok: oily, crispy outside, chewy inside, good filling. - Fried dumpling: pork, shrimp, woodear, wonton skin, deep-fried. - Egg tart: inconsistent quality, buttery flaky crust or dry crust.","Positive reviews of HK Dim Sum highlight the better than average food, large shumai and other items, and tasty dishes.

Their rolls only have 2 prawns vs the normal 3 you get eating at most dim sum places so the ratio here is definitely more noodle roll.
