0,Disgusting. Ordered on Uber eats and it was awful quality of food . The chicken was PINK still. You can also tell they use nasty oil (and probably don't clean the oil) to fry everything in. I didn't even finish eating it even though I was starving. I am not a picky eater either.

1,Disgusting!!! Do not eat here. Ordered on doordash. Not even one star. Chicken was pink still and not crispy or spicy at all. Disgusting. Also fries are like 5 dollars extra and they only serve you a few fries. Not worth spending your money or risking your health!!,*Chicken was pink still and not crispy or spicy at all. *Disgusting.,* Undercooked and unsatisfactory chicken, ,

3,"This place is up on door dash, I don't even know if it's the same place but, if it is, it's fake. Just ordered the vegan burger, and when I took a bite, it tasted like real meat. Lo and behold, it was real f-cking meat. Absolutely disgusting, and extremely disrespectful.  I ordered the vegan burger, i have a diet restriction due to my health, so ive been vegan to accommodate my health. I can't eat real meat, I can't eat dairy, and these wise guys here either don't care, are discriminatory towards vegans, or are just stupid stupid and stupid.  We can sue you for this. Don't be surprised if you get sued.","*Just ordered the vegan burger, but it had real meat, absolutely disgusting.","* Ordered vegan burger, received real meat instead", ,

Customers have complained about undercooked chicken, poor quality food, and dirty oil being used for frying. One review mentioned that they had ordered a vegan burger, but received real meat instead. Other complaints included cold and tasteless food, and onion rings that were not breaded but rather fried onions. Overall, it seems that there is a consistent issue with food quality at this restaurant, with many customers expressing dissatisfaction with their experience."
