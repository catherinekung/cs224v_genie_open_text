0,Disgusting. Ordered on Uber eats and it was awful quality of food . The chicken was PINK still. You can also tell they use nasty oil (and probably don't clean the oil) to fry everything in. I didn't even finish eating it even though I was starving. I am not a picky eater either. DO NOT EAT HERE,Bullet points: - Poor quality of food - Chicken was pink still.,

3,"This place is up on door dash, I don't even know if it's the same place but, if it is, it's fake. Just ordered the vegan burger, and when I took a bite, it tasted like real meat. Lo and behold, it was real f-cking meat. Absolutely disgusting, and extremely disrespectful.  I ordered the vegan burger, i have a diet restriction due to my health, so ive been vegan to accommodate my health. I can't eat real meat, I can't eat dairy, and these wise guys here either don't care, are discriminatory towards vegans, or are just stupid stupid and stupid.  We can sue you for this. Don't be surprised if you get sued.",Bullet points: - User ordered a vegan burger - Burger tasted like real meat - It was discovered that the burger contained real meat - User found this disgusting and disrespectful,

6, , ,"Based on the bullet points provided, it seems that there are some major concerns with the food quality at Beverly Hills Burger Bungalow. The most common negative feedback was that the chicken was undercooked or pink in color. This was mentioned in multiple bullet points and seems to be a consistent issue. Additionally, some customers reported that the chicken was not crispy or spicy, and the fried chicken sandwich was served cold. Another area of concern was the breading on the chicken sandwich, with some customers feeling that there was too much of it. Some also reported that the chicken was smashed too thin, leading to a less satisfying texture. There was also one instance of a customer ordering a vegan burger, but finding out that it contained real meat. This was a major problem for the customer, who felt disrespected by the mistake. Overall, the food quality was consistently reported as poor, with issues such as overcooked, cold, and chewy food. Onion rings were also mentioned as not meeting customer expectations, with some reporting that they were not breaded properly."
