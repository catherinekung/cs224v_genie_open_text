I'll be honest that I wasn't a fan of the noodles inside the quesadilla but I will say that it tasted very much like pho w/ the addition of the tortilla.    The BBH burrito blew my mind on the other hand.  This was spicy and the broth that came w/ it acted like a dipping sauce but it didn't need it.  The burrito wasn't dry - tasted bomb on its own.  I will come back to order 5 of these.    BTW - word has it that they have tamales now!  Check this place out on IG and try it for yourself.  Now more than ever it's important to not only eat well, be happy, and support local businesses!",*found this place whilst scrolling through IG *wasn't a fan of the noodles inside the quesadilla *tasted very much like pho w/ the addition of the tortilla *The BBH burrito blew my mind *spicy and the broth that came w/ it acted like a dipping sauce but it didn't need it *The burrito wasn't dry - tasted bomb on its own *they have tamales now,"* Discovered on Instagram * Noodles in quesadilla unappealing * Tasted like pho with tortilla * BBH burrito: spicy, mind-blowing * Broth provided as dipping sauce, but not necessary * Tasty standalone burrito * Now serving tamales", ,

2, , , , ,"Food quality at Quarantine Express has received mixed reviews. Some customers found the noodle quesadilla to be unappealing, describing the taste as pho with a tortilla. However, the BBH burrito received high praise for its spicy and mind-blowing flavor, with the accompanying broth as an unnecessary but available option. Tamales are now being served, and one reviewer found the food to be fine overall. In summary, the food at Quarantine Express has its hits and misses, with some dishes being highly appreciated while others not quite meeting expectations."
