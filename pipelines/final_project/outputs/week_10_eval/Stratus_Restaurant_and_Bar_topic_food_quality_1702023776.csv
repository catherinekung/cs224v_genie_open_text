0,"This was a cocktail pre-game before a dinner date. It is a hotel bar, which is not a bad thing and we liked it.  Nice service, average selections on liquor but it was a really nice place if you want to meet up with people as the environment is a hotel lounge-y type place. Bar seating as well.  I recommend for work meetings, low-key day drinking, even sports watching if you just want to have a second to breathe away from your home.",No relevant information found., , , 
1,"Your basic hotel restaurant, offering a reasonable menu. Decent quality and service, and pricing.",*Decent quality,* Quality is decent, , 
2,"New area. New Holiday Inn. Small restaurant in the lobby of a nice hotel. (Holiday Inn)  Drinks were awesome. Juan our bartender & server was great. Because of Mr M's recent injury we didn't go up to the rooftop area which they said was great. But the restaurant and bar are not quite finished. So We will return to check it out...  The fish tacos were undercooked and too bland for me, Mr M liked them okay... They took way too long due to the cook calling in sick, they needed to get someone else in the kitchen. Will return to try other items on the menu, hopefully on the rooftop!",*The fish tacos were undercooked and too bland for me *Mr M liked them okay,"* Undercooked, bland fish tacos * Mr M found them acceptable", , 
3,Nice place! Location is close to the hotel I stayed. I ordered the sandwich and fries. Fries are perfect made! Sandwich is a little bit dry. I'm not a big fan of that. The environment is very cozy and welcoming. Overall it's a very good experience!,*Fries are perfect made *Sandwich is a little bit dry,* Perfect fries * Dry sandwich, , 
4,We celebrated my father in law's milestone birthday party here. Location is a gem. I haven't seen any other roof top venues around the areA. Party started a little before sunset and the ambiance got better as sun started going down. Service and food was unparalleled. All the guests kept taking about the place. We were ~40 people. We didn't need but it has banquet halls. It can accommodate rooms for outside guests since downstairs is holiday inn. We have stayed in many holiday inns but this is very good with service and decor. Most convenient for silicon valley locations.  I will definitely come back in future  either as hosts as guests.,*Service and food was unparalleled,* Unparalleled service and food, , 
5,Very convenient restaurant / bar located just off the lobby of a relative new and nicely appointed Holiday Inn just off Dixon Landing Road area of Milpitas.  I always add \,No relevant information found., , , 
6,I ate here twice and I recommend you try the chicken ceaser salad and the chicken queso.   It was very tasty!,*chicken ceaser salad and the chicken queso *It was very tasty!,* Chicken Caesar salad and chicken queso * Very tasty, , 
7,Service is excellent and food and drinks are good but it should be noted that this is in the lobby of a hotel! This is probably the reason it's a tad pricey. They have a rooftop which is actually very nice and faces the sunset.,*food and drinks are good,* Good food and drinks, , 
8,"Hoping this place would be better but was very disappointed. It's a restaurant located in the lobby of holiday inn. First, the bartender/server didn't even greet us or look at us for over 5 minutes (besides one other table of 2, we are the only ones there) and continued to act like he was afraid to come to the table or serve us. He was nice but we just didn't feel welcomed. Then they didn't have any olives or olive juice for dirty martinis which is weird but whatever I ordered something else. The thing that really got me is I ordered the skirt steak and it was served with green beans that were frozen or old and INSTANT MASHED POTATOES! (I've eaten them many times in my life so I knew instantly) Not to mention one shot of Jameson was $18...won't be going back again. Hope they could get their act together because the bar and eating area was pretty nice.  P.s. only thing that was good was the chicken Caesar salad. 1 star for the salad and 1 star for the nice bar","*ordered the skirt steak, served with green beans that were frozen or old *Instant mashed potatoes *only thing that was good was the chicken Caesar salad",* Skirt steak with poor-quality green beans * Instant mashed potatoes * Good chicken Caesar salad, , 
9,"So they just opened everyone. Not only is the restaurant beautiful but so is the entire facility. They did a wonderful job putting it together. I could only imagine how many of these neighboring companies are gonna stop by for a quick bite or a tasty cocktail after a long day. The menu isn't too big yet not too small either. Just enough for everyone to find everything they're craving. The liquor selection is enormous and they have a few nice beers on draft. The food comes quickly and drinks are all very pretty. I definitely recommend stopping by if you're near Dixon Landing. A new add to the city of  Milpitas, especially if you're looking for quality ingredients prepared honestly and sold affordable. I'm coming back",*The menu isn't too big yet not too small either *The food comes quickly *quality ingredients prepared honestly and sold affordably,* Moderate menu size * Quick food service * Quality ingredients and affordable pricing, ,
