0,Black pepper mushroom onion scallion - house suggestion! - solid dish with some wonderful flavors and heat - I ate it with some jicama wraps from TJ's and the cold jicama tempered the heat nicely.  Will need to try more of this menu.,*Black pepper mushroom onion scallion - house suggestion!,* Black pepper mushroom onion scallion - house suggestion, , 
1,"Seems like in the last few years Momo trucks have been popping up over the South Bay. Next to the old liquor store this space has been numerous Mexican trucks and carts, now it's a Himalayan/Indian truck which seems to be half redone from a previous concept. It's next to the staple Mamacitas truck so you wont lose your Mexican eats either should you decide to double up. Got tge chicken combo gravy with noodles and a lassi. Piping hot , spicy and solid flavor. Id say it's comparable to most of your Desi Chinese restaurant choices nearby without a restaurant setting. They do have a single folding table outside but it's unshaded so it can be pretty scorching depending on the daylight. Good for a filling quick to go option personally","*Got the chicken combo gravy with noodles and a lassi *Piping hot, spicy, and solid flavor *Comparable to most Desi Chinese restaurant choices nearby","* Ordered chicken combo gravy, noodles, and lassi * Hot, spicy, and flavorful * Similar to nearby Desi Chinese restaurants", , 
2,"I went for lunch and ended up getting the honey chicken (may not be the exact order name). I had actually ordered the chicken noodles, but they had accidentally given them to a different group who began eating before we realized. They offered to remake my dish but the other group and I were fine swapping plates, so I took the honey chicken. The chicken was somewhat crispy and the sauce was flavorful but not too sweet or salty -- overall I'd say a decent dish one may find in a Chinese restaurant. The portion was very large and easily fed me, someone who eats a lot, for two meals (though I supplemented with rice). Overall a solid option, though at this point frankly I'd prefer getting the super burrito at Mamacita's next door.",*honey chicken was somewhat crispy *sauce was flavorful but not too sweet or salty *portion was very large *Overall a solid option,* Honey chicken: crispy * Flavorful sauce: not too sweet or salty * Large portion * Solid option overall, , 
3,"There's nothing or no other better Napoli's restaurant than this truck. When I first came here by accident I ended up getting almost everything off the menu and everything was literally a work of art, and Artisanal. The staff are dynamic friendly tightknit and really good people. I can't rave and rant about this restaurant more than I already have to all my friends because it truly is the best restaurant at 30 mile radius from Los Altos. Keep up the good work guys. You guys are excellent","*everything off the menu and everything was literally a work of art, and Artisanal",* Menu items - artistic and artisanal, ,
