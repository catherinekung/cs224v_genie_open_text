0,Disgusting. Ordered on Uber eats and it was awful quality of food . The chicken was PINK still. You can also tell they use nasty oil (and probably don't clean the oil) to fry everything in. I didn't even finish eating it even though I was starving. I am not a picky eater either.

1,Disgusting!!! Do not eat here. Ordered on doordash. Not even one star. Chicken was pink still and not crispy or spicy at all. Disgusting. Also fries are like 5 dollars extra and they only serve you a few fries.

3,"This place is up on door dash, I don't even know if it's the same place but, if it is, it's fake. Just ordered the vegan burger, and when I took a bite, it tasted like real meat. Lo and behold, it was real f-cking meat. Absolutely disgusting, and extremely disrespectful.  I ordered the vegan burger, i have a diet restriction due to my health, so ive been vegan to accommodate my health. I can't eat real meat, I can't eat dairy, and these wise guys here either don't care, are discriminatory towards vegans, or are just stupid stupid and stupid.  We can sue you for this. Don't be surprised if you get sued.","*Ordered the vegan burger, but it tasted like real meat *Absolutely disgusting, and extremely disrespectful *Can't eat real meat or dairy due to health reasons",* Vegan burger tasted like real meat * Disgusting and disrespectful * Can't consume meat or dairy for health reasons, ,

I have Lupus I am limited on going out to eat, but you hope trying a new restaurant would be a good experience.  This is not the place.",*Nasty...nasty...,* Unpleasant experience, , 
6, , , , ,"Reviews on the food quality at Beverly Hills Burger Bungalow seem to be predominantly negative. Major issues include undercooked chicken, unpleasant frying oil, and small servings of fries for the price. In addition, there are concerns with the fried chicken sandwich being cold, thin, and excessively breaded. For vegan customers, there was dissatisfaction with the vegan burger resembling real meat, which was both unpleasant and disrespectful to their dietary needs. Other issues include over-cooked, cold, and chewy food, leading to an overall unpleasant experience. Based on these reviews, the food quality at Beverly Hills Burger Bungalow is in need of significant improvement."
