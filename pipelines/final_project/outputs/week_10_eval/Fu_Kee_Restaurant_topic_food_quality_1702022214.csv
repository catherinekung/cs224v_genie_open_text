1,"We decided to try their food for brunch for the first time. Place : it needs some cleaning, floor is filthy and the inside is extremely warm. we had to find a shaded area outside to eat. It's located in a shopping complex w some establishments such as Ross, Lucky's, gym, nail salon post office, McDonalds, etc. Parking: lots of parking spaces  FOOD: spicy chicken 4/5 fried rice 2/5 soup1/5 Chicken noodle soup: 2/5 it's quite bland, more of tap water taste (seriously). Im not gonna lie- I'm not coming back. I should've ordered Panda Express, at least I get a fortune cookie","*spicy chicken 4/5 *fried rice 2/5 *Chicken noodle soup: 2/5 it's quite bland, more of tap water taste (seriously)",* Ratings of food items: * Spicy chicken: 4/5 * Fried rice: 2/5 * Chicken noodle soup: 2/5 * Soup tasted bland and like tap water, , 
2,"This is my very first time I came for the dim sum for my elderly mother.  We've been blessed or you can say we've been spoiled to enjoy the yummy dim sum from any good dim sum restaurants around San Jose & Milpitas. Since my family has moved here to the south side, and during my daily routine walks I checked this place out. It happened on the rainy day a couple days ago so I assumed I wouldn't have to be waiting for the orders too long; well, I was wrong! They had me waited for more than 30 minutes. They charged me $62.89 for 9 small orders. When I got home & ready to feed my mother, we're so disappointed when we saw the foods; they're either small or missing ( one box has only 2 pieces of some kind they called Pan Fried Taro Shrimp Cake); others like Pan Fried Dumplings & Steamed Buns are so thickened & hard & dried for the buns. Every order they added raw cabbage in there ( to make Ã­t looked full? Lol) We ended up not enjoying the foods. My mother gave up after trying 1 little piece of Chicken Siu Mai ( which is the only one tasted okay). We feel like we've wasted money because we're throwing the foods out! Definitely we don't ever want to come back there & not recommend this business to any of my friends , family or relatives.",*small or missing orders *Pan Fried Dumplings & Steamed Buns are so thickened & hard & dried *Chicken Siu Mai is the only one tasted okay,* Small or missing orders * Negative feedback on Pan Fried Dumplings and Steamed Buns * Chicken Siu Mai was the only dish that tasted good, , 
3,"Today, I place order for take out mango chicken. When I ate it, that was not mango that I had about 4 years ago. Instead yellow items were not well cooked potatoes and they made it fake. They should be honest to customers. If they do like this, Customer will come one time only. I had to throw away it which they charged me $16.41. If there is zero star, I will put zero. Will never go there anymore and share my experience to my coworkers not to be like me.",*yellow items were not well cooked potatoes and they made it fake *I had to throw it away.,* Poorly cooked potatoes * Ended up throwing it away, , 
4,Solid good Chinese food. I had no issues with my door dash order. I loved the Shanghai pork dumplings and the mushu chicken appetizer! I'll be back to get those items again.,*I loved the Shanghai pork dumplings and the mushu chicken appetizer!,* Shanghai pork dumplings were loved * Mushu chicken appetizer was loved, , 
5,"Their food is excellent. Their to go packaging is why I can't love them.   The good  Dim sum - really good. Had chicken doughy one and crab cake small Wonton soup- chicken wontons and bok choy are great! Nice variety of healthy choices  The bad Cashier not wearing mask properly and another time in the kitchen it was completely off. Packaging of soup sucks! Yesterday I got my soup delivered and it was leaking.  Today I go in person and the bag isn't secure. The knot unties and the soup drops to the ground in front of my car.   APPARENTLY YOU NEED ANOTHER WAY TO SECURE YOUR SOUPS TO GO.  Fortunately, I had time to wait for them to replace my order.   I was happier before I came in and saw behind the scenes. Again great food... but at what cost?? Get it together Fu Kee. Right now y'all are more like Funk-y.",*Dim sum - really good *Wonton soup- chicken wontons and bok choy are great!,* Dim sum is really good * Wonton soup with chicken wontons and bok choy is great, , 
6,"Went there for lunch. we tried the Chao Zhou Crab Cakes and it was dry and not good. The red sauce that came with it was watery sugar water. Also tried the Roasted Garlic Basil Crispy Pork (too dry over cooked), Vegetable Pad Thai (was ok nut no Thai Noodle), and Crispy Tofu Mandarin Sauce (taste was good). Our bill total was $54.14. This place was too expensive for the food quality. The quantity is good just not the quality. The interior appeared clean and girl at the register was friendly. There are things on the menu to try but that maybe a while for me to return. They must be doing something right they have been there for 15 years.",*Chao Zhou Crab Cakes were dry and not good *Roasted Garlic Basil Crispy Pork was too dry and overcooked *Vegetable Pad Thai was ok *Crispy Tofu Mandarin Sauce taste was good *Too expensive for the food quality *Quantity is good just not the quality.,* Poor quality Chao Zhou Crab Cakes and Roasted Garlic Basil Crispy Pork * Average quality Vegetable Pad Thai * Good taste of Crispy Tofu Mandarin Sauce * Food is expensive for the quality * Quantity is good but not the quality, ,

9,"This is a cozy restaurant for small parties of up to four, unless you put tables together.  The restaurant serves a special meal of large rice,  choice of one of two appetizers, and choice of two main dishes out of many choices for $32.  We ordered an additional egg roll appetizer,  the egg rolls were crunchy, with lots of vegetables.  We enjoyed both main dishes, with food to spare for another future meal. We plan to come again with more friends.  This is a sister restaurant to my favorite, Ginger Cafe, in Gilroy.  They have a Ginger Cafe in Sunnyvale,  and also two more locations.","*egg rolls were crunchy, with lots of vegetables *enjoyed both main dishes *food to spare for another future meal.",* Egg rolls were crunchy and had lots of vegetables * Enjoyed both main dishes * Had enough food for another meal in the future, , 
10,"Good food, Good people... 1 stars off because of extra ice quantity in thai ice tea than what is necessary. Nice people, they explained this is how they normally do it, $7.00 seems a bit expensive for this much ice. Do you agree with me there should be less ice in thai ice tea?",*Good food,* Good food, , 
11,"Honestly I came in looking for a healthy meal, so I chose the vegetarian Kung pao expecting something light. The tofu is fried and when you bite into it, it's very oily with little to no flavor. At least now I know I should skip the tofu meal here. Portion was pretty good but I never understand why tofu dishes are more than $10.","*tofu is fried and when you bite into it, it's very oily with little to no flavor.",* Tofu is oily with little flavor * Tofu is fried, , 
12,"My understanding this is a sister restaurant of Ginger Cafe and they both have similar menu (with Ginger cafe being a higher end restaurant and Fukee as the fast food option  We have been eating Fukee for more than 7 years since we moved to south San Jose, both dine in and take out. We used to always bring our dog and dine outdoor.  The vegetarian option is the bomb here and there is no comparison in other similar American Chinese restaurants. Their vegetarian foods are the reason that we keep coming back. Our favorites are:  1. Vegetable de Asia 2. Crispy mandarin tofu 3. Vegetarian kung pao  They have some really good non vegetarian dishes as well, my favorite being Potato beef.  Service is semi fast food where you have to order at the counter and pick up your own food but they will clean up the dishes after the meal. Haven't dined in door since pandemic so not sure if things have changed","*Vegetarian option is the bomb here and there is no comparison in other similar American Chinese restaurants *vegetarian foods are the reason that we keep coming back *Our favorites are: 1.

13,We found a cute spot while waiting for a doctor appt nearby.  Totally underrated.  The dim sum is flavorful and steamed right. We had the sample platter and our favorite was the squid ink!  The eggplant plate was also spiced just right. Beautiful flavors.  Last the red bean sesame ball crispy and sticky enough.

16,Went to Fu Kee for lunch today. I ordered shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken rice bowl. I paid $26 for these two items. The shrimp fried rice was $15 it only had four small pieces of shrimp. The teriyaki chicken bowl was not dressed with teriyaki sauce yet it had A small container that contained about 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce that's not enough to dress your rice and chicken and the chicken was completely dry. For the amount of money for two items you would expect a little bit more.
