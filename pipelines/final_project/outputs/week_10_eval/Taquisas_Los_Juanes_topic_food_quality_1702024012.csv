3,"I hired Los Juanes for a birthday party a few weeks back and the food was delicious! The staff is very professional yet fun at the same time. They are also very clean which is a huge deal for me. I was a little nervous to hire them because they had just started up not too long ago but I have no regrets. I loved how they had a variety of different items that they offer, not just tacos. I will definitely hire them again!","*the food was delicious *variety of different items offered, not just tacos","* Delicious food * Variety of items, not just tacos", ,
