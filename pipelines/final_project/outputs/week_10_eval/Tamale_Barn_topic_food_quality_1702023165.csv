0,"AVOID: don't waste your time or money! Not a serious business!   We have tried this pace twice: once ordering via door dash and once from the restaurants online website tool. Both times we were extremely disappointed as the orders were canceled last minute, after payment being taken & ordered confirmed.   Tonight, our DoorDash driver waiting for over 45min w/no communication from the restaurant. They finally canceled the order on him with no explanation.   Perhaps this was fate stepping in to save us from a horrible dining experience.",No relevant information found., , , 
1,I was extremely curious to try this new restaurant specializing in Tamales. They looked like they have a variety of vegetarian savory or sweet options.  Unfortunately the experience was terrible. My delivery order never got made and when I called the lady on the phone (owner?) was quite rude saying if I wanted to order I needed to come into the restaurant.  That defeats the point of delivery.  Hence I didn't try the food there yet but I will probably give it another shot in the future if it still exists.,No relevant information found., , , 
2,"I'm not sure if I ordered on the wrong day, but I ordered 6 tamales. Each and every one was SO dry, and the masa would crumble to the touch. It made it impossible to eat them with a fork, so we picked them up with our hands. Unfortunately we ended up throwing the majority away as the filling was extremely dry, and the masa on quite a few of them was so dried out it was hardened. Though this is likely because they were over cooked, it makes me nervous that they may have been old and leftover.",*ordered 6 tamales *Each and every one was SO dry *the masa would crumble to the touch *filling was extremely dry *masa on quite a few of them was so dried out it was hardened *likely because they were overcooked,* Ordered 6 tamales * Very dry and crumbly masa * Dry filling * Likely overcooked, ,

The masa was described as dry and crumbly, and the filling was also dry, indicating that the tamales were likely overcooked. Overall, this particular review suggests a negative experience with the food quality at Tamale Barn."
