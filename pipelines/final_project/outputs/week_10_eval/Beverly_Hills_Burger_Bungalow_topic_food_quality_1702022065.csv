0,Disgusting. Ordered on Uber eats and it was awful quality of food . The chicken was PINK still. You can also tell they use nasty oil (and probably don't clean the oil) to fry everything in. I didn't even finish eating it even though I was starving. I am not a picky eater either. DO NOT EAT HERE,*awful quality of food *The chicken was PINK still,* Poor quality of food * Chicken was pink, , 
1,Disgusting!!! Do not eat here. Ordered on doordash. Not even one star. Chicken was pink still and not crispy or spicy at all. Disgusting.

3,"This place is up on door dash, I don't even know if it's the same place but, if it is, it's fake. Just ordered the vegan burger, and when I took a bite, it tasted like real meat. Lo and behold, it was real f-cking meat. Absolutely disgusting, and extremely disrespectful.  I ordered the vegan burger, i have a diet restriction due to my health, so ive been vegan to accommodate my health. I can't eat real meat, I can't eat dairy, and these wise guys here either don't care, are discriminatory towards vegans, or are just stupid stupid and stupid.  We can sue you for this. Don't be surprised if you get sued.","*Just ordered the vegan burger, but it had real meat, absolutely disgusting.",* Received a non-vegan burger despite ordering a vegan burger, ,

6, , , , ,"The reviews for the food quality at Beverly Hills Burger Bungalow are predominantly negative. Many customers have complained about the poor quality of food, with undercooked chicken and cold, tasteless dishes. Some have mentioned receiving the wrong order, with non-vegan burgers instead of vegan ones. The negative reviews also detail issues with the texture and taste of the food, such as over-cooking and a lack of crispiness or spice. Overall, the sentiment is that the food at Beverly Hills Burger Bungalow is subpar and not enjoyable."
