4,"Well, I came here not reading any of the reviews, which I regret. The food was mediocre or better said not worth it. The micheladas were a TOTAL disappointment. I was expecting better for the east side, so I hope they step it up. The service was not great either. The only positive thing is that the place is big, and they have loud music.",*The food was mediocre or better said not worth it.,* Mediocre food quality * Not worth the price, , 
5,"Came in today for an early dinner. First time here. Ordered the breaded fish fillet platter and the molcajete de Mariacos. The presentation of their dishes and drinks are appetizing and look really delicious, however, for my taste it was a bit lacking. This is just my opinion, the food needed to be better seasoned and needed salt. The fish in the molcajete was a bit fishy tasting and the shrimp needed some salt. Maybe it's an off day for them, who knows, will give them another try in the future.",*food needed to be better seasoned and needed salt *the fish in the molcajete was a bit fishy tasting and the shrimp needed some salt.,* Food lacked seasoning and needed salt * Fish in the molcajete had a strong fishy taste and shrimp needed salt, , 
6,It was starting off good with all drinks. We got to the food and my sister found a fly in her rice and a cockroach in the drink. It was totally disgusting.  Empezaba bien con todas las bebidas. Llegamos a la comida y mi hermana encontró una mosca en su arroz y una cucaracha en la bebida. Fue totalmente repugnante. Que asco de veras,*Found a fly in her rice and a cockroach in the drink.,* Insect found in food and drink., , 
7,"Make sure to check your receipt they will add things you didn't order. They will add a tip, which isn't the problem but how does 30 dollar tip make sense on a 118 dollar tab. They will tax you twice and their explanation doesn't even make sense. BE AWARE!!!",No relevant information found., , ,

11,"Hummm... service was okay. Waitress was attentive. Food was not good, no taste at all. Ordered some oyster shots and man oysters were bad. We let the waitress know and she said she would let the cook know and finally came back and told us that she could give us 2 more oyster's. We were already grossed out and politely told her no and paid the full tab.","*Food was not good, no taste at all. *Ordered some oyster shots and man oysters were bad.",* Food had no taste * Oysters were bad, ,

14,"If I was able to give it zero stars I would. Food was all brought out for our party except one dish, waited another 25 minutes before getting the plate. Once we were done we received the check with a tip of 50% instead of 15%. We told the waitress and she said it was correct it was 15% and that's how the restaurant works. I then showed her what 15% was, her face dropped. Food is okay, service is horrible.",*Food is okay,* Average quality of food, , 
15,"WORST PLACE EVER!!!! customer service sucks food took forever, waitress spilled my drink, the added a $50 tip without my husband's acknowledgement then when he checked the card statement they took more than what they stated on the bill slip. Then they blamed it on the store next to them stating that the waffles took the card. I do not trust these people they did not give me 0 explanation to the issue. They stated that the tip was automatically put on the bill but we did not want to leave a tip due to the worst service i have ever had. THEY ARE SCAMMING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR MONEY.",No relevant information found., , ,

17,"Horrible service. Horrible food. Horrible atmosphere.   You've shoved all these tables in here yet you sit everyone in one god damn corner. You then take my order and prepare the pool table per my request however you take your time getting my food out, and then give the table away to other people. I ordered the fajitas which was as fresh as a microwaveable hungryman...  And I woulda preferred one of those. The waitress then never came back with the tortillas she said she'd bring (b/c how do you eat fijitas without tortillas?!). Never coming back.",*Horrible food. *fajitas which was as fresh as a microwaveable hungryman.,* Poor quality fajitas, ,
