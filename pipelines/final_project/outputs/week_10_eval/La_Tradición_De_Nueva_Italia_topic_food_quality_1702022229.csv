1,"Unfortunately very disappointed. The price was not worth it.  We happened to be in the mood for tacos and decided to be adventurous, and didn't even look at reviews ('gasp' omg) just went to the 1st taco truck we saw. We got our order to go, they pack onions and cilantro and lemons in a Ziploc which was cool. However I'm gonna go ahead and assume that the main upside to this place is that their tortillas are handmade, which I guess is a plus? However, my bf didn't even get the right order he got different meats and they were all just asada. Don't even get me started on what they call a quesadilla, it was the saddest thing I ever did see... And looked exactly like a freaking taco. Everything was more tortilla than anything, barely any meat and lacked flavor. Personally, I will not be coming back.","*Everything was more tortilla than anything, barely any meat and lacked flavor.","* Mainly tortilla, little meat and lacked flavor", , 
2,"Food was so good. I ordered menudo, it was one of the best menudos I had. My husband ordered Birria and its was delicious. Most plates are served with home made tortillas.

4,"I'm not one to complain but these were the worst tacos I have ever had. Tortilla was cold, barely any meat, no cilantro , lime, flavorless. One of the tacos meat also tasted odd. $18 for 5 flavorless/ barely any meat tacos is not worth it to me. Really disappointing.","*Tortilla was cold *barely any meat *no cilantro, lime *flavorless *One of the tacos meat also tasted odd",* Cold tortilla * Scanty meat * Missing cilantro and lime * Flavorless * One of the taco's meat had an odd taste, ,

7,"Tried for first time, to start cashier was rude not just to me to other customers also. Customers would ask questions and just like she was bothered. A man came back saying my order was wrong and she said no the way you asked for your food he was going back and forth making the man feel dumb. Anyway food was dry after them also getting my order wrong she also told me I ordered wrong when it was just a taco de birria and taco de lengua both squishy, regardless my first and last time not only service was bad but food was dry and flavorless.",*food was dry *flavorless,* Dry food * Flavorless food, ,

9,Cash and Venmo is accepted. Quesobirria tacos were great! Only downside is to-go orders you don't get the consume (soup). I believe if you eat there then you are given the soup with the quesobirria tacos. Wait time was around 10-15 minutes after ordering. Staff was friendly and saw that they were hand making their tortillas which makes it taste even better :) Parking is limited. Would definitely come again!!,*Quesobirria tacos were great!,* Quesobirria tacos were great, ,

Some reviews mentioned that the food lacked flavor and was dry, while others found the food to be delicious and homemade. Some customers praised the menudo and birria as the best they've had, while others mentioned that the tacos were flavorless and lacking in meat. The homemade tortillas and salsas seemed to be a hit with most customers. Overall, the sentiment is mixed, with some customers loving the food and others finding it lacking in flavor."
