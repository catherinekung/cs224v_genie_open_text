0,"Parking: cramped and crowded. The plaza is very busy so cars are constantly coming in and out. It's in the same plaza as Duc Huong, which gets plenty of customers coming and going.   Front: they have a big banner over the door with their name on it. Can't miss it.   Inside: one line towards the register. It looks like they used to do indoor dining but all the tables are blocked off. Their dim sum items are displayed in glass so it's nice to see what they have. Menu is hung high on the wall. They still have their barriers up which is fine with me.   Service: I haven't been to one of these places in a while so getting yelled at by the Auntie was very nostalgic. I didn't take it personally and no one else should. The uncle was much nicer when he was helping me with the roast duck and pork ears. I do wish the pork ears were sliced thinner but guess no one really has time for that. The Auntie speaks at least three languages: English, Cantonese and Vietnamese.   Food: I would say better than average. Their shumai was huge as were most other items. I ordered quite a few items and everything tasted good. It satisfied the dim sum craving. I am pretty sensitive to overly salty food but eating this, I was fine.   Price: average pricing  Overall, I will definitely be back.   (Ok so the reason why I got yelled at was because  I asked to see the itemized receipt 15 minutes after I had already paid and left. I was waiting for my Duc Huong order and I wasn't able to calculate why my order came out to $63. I thought I got half a duck but it turned out, I got a whole duck, which was what I ordered but I also saw half a duck get hung back up when I was ordering so I got confused. The uncle that helped me remembered that I spoke Chinese so he reminded the Auntie when she was shit talking about me in Chinese. It was pretty funny, I didn't take it personally and I still got what I wanted, the itemized receipt. I checked the boxes when I got back to the car and I did indeed get a whole duck.)","Bullet points: - Better than average food. - Huge shumai and most other items. - Good taste for all the items ordered. - Satisfied dim sum craving. - Not overly salty, suitable for those sensitive to salt."
1,"This place is horrible!  Ordered some items on doordash... Cocktail buns - never got them, they substituted with more hot dog buns instead of contacting me or refunding me! Hot dog buns - there was only half a hot dog in the bun so it's 90% bread. This is the first time I've seen a hot dog bun where the hot dog wasn't whole! I get times are hard but what the....  Fried Taro with shrimp/pork - I threw this out, it smelled like ammonia :( which means they either started with pork or shrimp that went bad or they refried and served me old food? Either way I actually had taken a couple of bites of this before noticing it was off? Got a stomach ache a few hours later. Har Gow - only thing that was OK. It gets 1 star for this.   TLDR - SKIP, old rotten food, they're totally skimping! Go anywhere else.","Bullet points: - Cocktail buns were missing, and they were substituted without notice or refund. - Hot dog buns had only half a hot dog in them, which made them mostly bread. - Fried Taro with shrimp/pork had a bad smell of ammonia, and made the user sick a few hours later. - Har Gow was the only dish that was okay."
2,Came here many times getting various items. I like their variety of dim sum to go items and they have decent bbq pork. The photos I posted are some of the common things I get when I come by here.,Bullet points: - Variety of dim sum to go items. - Decent BBQ pork.
3,I got so much food for what I paid! They literally STUFFED the chow mein into the container until it was packed (only $6 too!) The pan fried chive dumplings were definitely more heavy and dense than the ones I'm used to but they were still tasty. I also had to grab an egg tart for dessert because its must. It was huge! I only took off a star because everything seemed a little extra greasy. But the flavor was there and I definitely recommend this spot if you're craving dimsum on a budget.,Bullet points: - Chow mein container was packed with food - Pan fried chive dumplings were heavy and dense but still tasty - Egg tart for dessert is a must - Flavor was good.
4,This satisfied my dim sum fix. Not the best but still pretty tasty. Each dim sum piece is hearty. The beef noodle roll was a sub for the prawn one but texture was still good.  I'd order again if I don't have time to go into a restaurant.,Bullet points: - Each dim sum piece is hearty. - Beef noodle roll was a substitute for the prawn one but texture was still good.
5,"This place always seems to satisfy my emergency dim sum cravings! It definitely isnt the best nor do they have the greatest service but they have your regular fixings up until late afternoon!  The siu mai/har gow are large and hearty. Ok in flavor!  The fried items are only good when fresh. I tried random assortments at random times of the day & here is my take. the chinese donuts were quite hard and stale so I do not recommend. The shrimp ball is very large but a little too oily for my liking. Taro ball was ok, lacked flavor. & the turnip cake was almost all cake barely any other texture or flavor but very large. Sesame ball also ok!   They also have combo meals which i thought was very cool! The congee it comes with is not bad either.   They give you packet sauces 2 in 1 combo for to go orders. Labeled for Mandu! So it definitely has a different taste to it, but the chili oil is good and has a neutral flavor  Also have a $15 minimum on card.   All in all it isnt the best, cheapest, or tastiest. But when I get a random craving I seem to always find myself here bc of the variety and convenience.","Bullet points: - Siu mai/har gow are large and hearty, okay in flavor. - Fried items are only good when fresh. - Chinese donuts were hard and stale, not recommended. - Shrimp ball is very large but a little too oily. - Taro ball lacked flavor. - Turnip cake was mostly cake with barely any other texture or flavor, very large. - Sesame ball was okay. - Combo meals available and are cool. - Congee that comes with combo meals is not bad."
6,"This review is for take-out only. I've ordered delivery from here through DoorDash multiple times and I've been very satisfied with the food each time. The prices are reasonable, the lunch specials are a great deal for a lot of food, and the food has been very good each time I've ordered.   I've been particularly impressed with their barbecue and roast meats. Their meats are much more flavorful and juicy compared to other local take-out dim sum places I've tried. The roast pork and roast duck have been good. The rice rolls are less dense than other places I've tried. Porridges are flavorful and other dim sum items I've tried generally have been delicious.  I consider this my go-to for take-out dim sum, as the food is significantly better compared to other local take-out dim sum places I've tried and the prices are reasonable.",Bullet points: - Impressive barbecue and roast meats. - Meats are more flavorful and juicy than other local take-out dim sum places. - Good roast pork and roast duck. - Rice rolls are less dense than other places. - Flavorful porridges. - Generally delicious dim sum items.
7,"I don't have to go to Ranch 99 for BBQ meats anymore!  Only thing I dislike is the parking and the area but they accept Visa/MC, offer succulent BBQ pork and roast pork and a limited selections of dim sum such as har gow, shiu mai, rice roll, steamed buns.. all satisfied my stressful Saturday.    I did not take photos of the dim sum because I ate it as soon as I got home but the meats I used it to pray and enjoyed after.  I would have stopped by but I thought it was a cash only establishment.","Bullet points: - Succulent BBQ pork and roast pork. - Limited selection of dim sum, including har gow, shiu mai, rice roll, and steamed buns. - Food was satisfying."
8,"Dynasty didn't open until 11 am and I was craving dim sum at 10. My daughter and I were really hungry so we came here to grab some to go. Everything was horrible and a waste of money. Lack of flavor, thickness in some items where it shouldn't be as thick. Peanuts added into certain dishes that do not normally have peanuts was weird. I wanted this to be a small mom and pop shop where I can get my favorite dim sum dishes to go... sadly it wasn't close to anything I've had before.",Bullet points: - Lack of flavor in food. - Some items are thicker than they should be. - Peanuts added to certain dishes that don't normally have them was odd.
9,"Price is really decent and food are tasty. I love duck and char xiu, roasted pork which are so juicy and fresh. I love all the dimsum option","Bullet points: - Loves duck and char xiu, as well as roasted pork for being juicy and fresh. - Enjoys all the dimsum options."
10,My family was craving dim sum the other day but it was raining really heavy so my bf ordered through door dash. The dim sum here is huge! If we had known we would've placed only 1 order of everything. But we ordered doubled on our favorites and the Shu mai are the size of golf balls. My son's favorite was the thousand year old preserve egg porridge with pork!,Bullet points: - Dim sum is huge - Favorites were ordered double - Shu mai are the size of golf balls - Thousand year old preserve egg porridge with pork is a favorite of son
11,"Given how expensive dim sum is nowadays, the prices here are more reasonable. You may not get your best dim sum, but it is good enough to satisfy your cravings. As for presentation, you can throw that out the door as well. Don't go thinking you'll find cute dim sum or incredible Instagramable food here.. it's all about bang for your buck and honestly the food is not bad. In fact, i much rather eat here than the dim sum from Sifu Wong Kitchen in santa clara -- knowing that it's cheap, you are NOT going to expect amazing fancy dimsum is more satisfactory than paying $8 for 4 ha gao for just average tasting filling.   Ha gao (shrimp dumpling): skin is SUPER thick i had to peel some of the skin off but the filling is tasty.   the siu mai and all the other items are really big - i have never seen such ginormous Ham Sui Gok (the glutinous football looking thing with filling) before. Though it's a bit too oily but overall the taste is there and it is crispy on the outside, chewy inside and you get a good amount of filling to mochi too. Not just a teaspoon of filling that you may get at a restaurant.   we also really like this fried dumpling with pork, shrimp, and woodear (forgot what it's called, but it's wrapped in wonton skin and deep fried).   the egg tart is a hit or missed. First time i had it was really good, buttery flaky crust with warm jiggly egg custard. The second time, the crust wasn't buttery and was a bit too dry.   Though it's only 3 stars, but yes i will definitely go back to HK dim sum!","Bullet points: - Shrimp dumpling has thick skin but tasty filling. - Siu mai and other items are really big. - Ham Sui Gok is oily but crispy on the outside, chewy inside and has a good amount of filling. - Fried dumpling with pork, shrimp, and woodear is liked by the user. - Egg tart can be hit or miss, with the crust being either buttery and flaky or a bit too dry."
12,"Placed an order through DoorDash since it was one of the few Dim Sum spots that delivered. We ordered sesame balls, shrimp dumpling, shu mai, sticky rice with lotus leaf, spareribs, steamed BBQ bun, fried turnip cake, and prawn rice rolls. We were surprised how affordable everything was and how fast we got our food delivered. Everything tasted delicious and we had plenty of leftovers.","Bullet points: - Ordered sesame balls, shrimp dumpling, shu mai, sticky rice with lotus leaf, spareribs, steamed BBQ bun, fried turnip cake, and prawn rice rolls. - Everything tasted delicious."
13,"Food was great. Very authentic tastes, nice and fast services as expected from a local Chinese restaurant. Waiter and server were very friendly and helpful, which is a little odd for the majority of restaurants of this types. Overall, i had s great meal, with tasty foods, friendly service at a very decent price.",Bullet points: - The food was great.
14,"Great togo Dim Sum. From steam dumplings, fried dumplings, chow fun, and Chinese BBQ. Fairly priced and quick service. Been coming back here on a weekly basis. You can also order ahead online on their website. They're located across the opposite side from the Vietnam town Grand Century mall and next to the Lion Supermarket on Story Road.","Bullet points: - Great togo Dim Sum. - Selection includes steam dumplings, fried dumplings, chow fun, and Chinese BBQ."
15,if you looking for a polite dining experience   this may mot be the spot for you  but if you're into  counter service dim sum  and dont mind mind orders mot being taken correctly and a half empty restaurant this might be your dpot, 
16,"Have ordered takeout for pickup here a few times via DoorDash at this point, and experience has been solid. Typically super quick to prepare the order, and portions are quite big - very filling! Quality of the food has been consistent in my experience and is similar to most dim-sum to-go places. I would say the porridge is overpriced for the quantity you get, but most of the dim sum items are very reasonably priced. Definitely a convenient option in the neighborhood when dining in for dim sum isn't an option.",Bullet points: - Consistent quality of food similar to other dim-sum to-go places. - Porridge is overpriced for the quantity. - Most dim sum items are reasonably priced.
17,9/5/2020 doordashed brunch  No fault of the restaurant that our doordash order was approximately 30 minutes late on arrival but what arrived wasn't exactly what we ordered let alone served cold.  We ordered $80 worth of stuff. The prawn rolls are my kids fav when eating dim sum and this place skimps yah a whole shrimp. Their rolls only have 2 prawns vs the normal 3 you get eating at most dim sum places so the ratio here is definitely more noodle roll.  Our \,Bullet points: - Prawn rolls are a favorite among kids. - Only two prawns in the rolls instead of the typical three. - The ratio of noodle to shrimp is higher compared to other dim sum places.
18,"Pretty good food considering the price, but you get what you pay for. Their shrimp dumplings were probably my favorite. Their preserved egg and pork porridge was also good, but not quite like what other dim sum places make. Their shumai was a bit off, would not recommend.",Bullet points: - Shrimp dumplings were the favorite. - Preserved egg and pork porridge was good but different from other dim sum places. - Shumai was not recommended as it was a bit off.
19,Big bun for $5.00‽ wow a little steep.  Dim sum looked good.  Bbq pork was good with roast pork.  4 people in line.  Strangely a restaurant closed and to go only.,Bullet points: - Dim sum looked good - BBQ pork was good with roast pork
