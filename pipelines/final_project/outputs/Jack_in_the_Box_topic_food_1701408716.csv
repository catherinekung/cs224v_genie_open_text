Best decision I ever made.  They made it so easy for me to order my food through the app, and they have a drive-thru pick up option which I definitely utilized. Once I was ready to leave work, I just pressed a button in the app and my order was sent to the restaurant to be started. Once I arrived at the drive-thru I told them my name and that I had an order for pick up to which I was ushered right up to the window. The app had automatically charged my card while I was driving over: HOW CONVENIENT IS THAT! So all I had to do was wait for my food. I was immediately given my drinks and only had to wait an extra 2-3 minutes since I had ordered quite a few chicken nuggets before I was given my order in its entirety.  My food was hot, fresh, and absolutely perfect. The night team made it so easy for me to order before leaving work and being able to just use the drive-thru and never have to leave my car. I also had an in-app coupon for a free order of mini churros, and I'm so glad I used it because they're my new favorite thing. Definitely using the Palo Alto Jack in the Box more often for when I'm hungry after late night urgent care emergencies!","*My food was hot, fresh, and absolutely perfect.","* Food was hot, fresh, and perfect", , 
1,"Wow. That was pretty bad. I know people don't go to yelp for fast food reviews but I should have looking at the other ones. Stopped here for breakfast and the hash brown was cold and way over cooked. The breakfast sandwich was a joke and the whole thing was $8.50. The whole interior is very bland and the table was dirty. You can expect a certain amount of quality, good and bad, from a fast food chain but this one is definitely missing the mark",*the hash brown was cold and way over cooked *the breakfast sandwich was a joke *the whole thing was $8.50.,* Overcooked and cold hash brown * Unsatisfactory breakfast sandwich * Total cost was $8., ,

Talk about the worst Jack in the Box ever . I highly suggest the management of this Jack in the box train there employees more professional or get new ones .",No relevant information found., , ,

6,"I'm giving this place five stars because the employees are lovely -- super friendly. But I hate myself every time I go here because the food is so unhealthy and not worth my clogged arteries. Except for maybe the tacos ... that stuff is irresistible.  I got the Jumbo Breakfast Platter once and felt horrible the rest of the day. The hash browns were soggy, pancakes tasted like plastic, and the bacon was limp.","*Except for maybe the tacos ... that stuff is irresistible. *I got the Jumbo Breakfast Platter once and felt horrible the rest of the day. *The hash browns were soggy, pancakes tasted like plastic, and the bacon was limp.","* Negative experience with Jumbo Breakfast Platter * Soggy hash browns, plastic tasting pancakes and limp bacon * Positive experience with tacos", ,

9,"Alright, listen up.  I'm out at night, and I'm lookin for some quick grub.  Jack in the box sounds good, I want a burger.  Usually you can get some pretty solid food by telling a burger joint you want a hamburger.  At jack in the box, this was not the case.

12,Ordered breakfast croissant with sausage and ham. The bread is shaped like a croissant and it's not flaky. The texture is just like a bread. Expensive for a breakfast sandwich. It's almost $5/ea and combo cost $7. Burger King still has the best and affordable breakfast croissant.,*The bread is shaped like a croissant and it's not flaky. *The texture is just like a bread. *Expensive for a breakfast sandwich.,"* Croissant-shaped bread, but not flaky * Texture is like regular bread * Expensive for a breakfast sandwich", , 
13,My new fancy Verizon Irritating Phone 'The Coupons App' told me that Jack In the Box was having a special buy one 'Buttery Burgers' and get one free.   After working out at the Equinox Gym down the street I really did not want to cook on a Friday night and was really hungry. So I was up for two burgers to go and a cold beer when I got home.  The first thing I asked if they were participating in the buy one get one free Buttery Burger offer as I have been burned by independent purveyors that buck the corporate offers like the Los Altos Round Table Pizza that would not honor the free personal pizza with the San Jose Sharks 'Four in the net free Pizza You Get.'  Once I knew they did offer the buy one get one free Buttery Burger the only downside was she kept pushing the Portobello Mushroom Buttery Jack which I see is no longer on the menu and probably the most inexpensive and most profit margin. One star off for that.   The lady that took my order was very nice considering she had to deal with the hungry general public all night long. She appeared to be one of those few genuine people that really enjoyed her job. The kind the undercover boss would want to reward.  Tried the Classic Buttery Jack and the Bacon Swill Buttery Jack and reheated them in the oven while I got my cold beer!  Great service (other than the upsell for the Portobello Mushroom Buttery Burger) for a Friday evening.  One of the downsides of this location is you can only make a right turn out of their location which can be a challenge if you want to go back northbound on El Camino Real.,*Two burgers to go and a cold beer when I got home *Tried the Classic Buttery Jack and the Bacon Swill Buttery Jack and reheated them in the oven *Great service for a Friday evening,* Ordered two burgers to go and a cold beer * Tried the Classic Buttery Jack and the Bacon Swill Buttery Jack * Reheated the burgers in the oven * Received great service on a Friday evening., , 
14,"How is it possible to make customers wait 20 minutes + for breakfast?   Eggs take 2 minutes to make, sausage the same. You can cook 6 or 8 eggs at once with their mold. There were 10 people in the lobby.   Mathematically how is it even possible to be that bad?  I'll add there were 6 people working",No relevant information found., , , 
15,"Ordered multiple things for my family. They all got their orders correct, unfortunately one of my orders was wrong. I ordered two ultimate cheese burger (I was very hungry), one of the burgers was swapped with a different burger which they added to much lettuce to this it's more veggie than patty. I don't even know if this burger is more or less than the burger I ordered.","*one of the burgers was swapped with a different burger *they added too much lettuce to this, it's more veggie than patty.",* Incorrect burger served * Excessive lettuce added to the burger, , 
16,Cashier working wasn't paying attention I repeated my order 4 times and she got it wrong and wanted to charge me what was missing from my order seems like she got mad when I told her my order need to train them to pay close attention to customers when they order now I don't have my full meal,No relevant information found., , , 
17,When it takes two hours to get a burger at Steak and Shake in Daily city it makes this dining establishment look like a great food option.  I order on 11/18/16 10:40pm a sourdough grilled chicken and curly fries with drink. Food is good - standard Jack and was prepared quickly. Store clean. Self serve machine worked and was the new type with endless soda options but it was out of regular Coke. Diet Coke worked and there was fresh brew ice tea.  Friendly five star workers here that know their stuff. Very well run in the kitchen. Fries super fresh even though it looked so slow that night. How do they do super fresh fries with low turn over?  The biggest concern here is that when I parked my car I noticed a big guy asking for money as I entered. I guess its a great place to stand because he gets a lot of foot traffic from people who enter and people who leave the drive through.    There is only one exit to this place so you will have to exit past the guy at the door asking for money. Doesn't really bother me but maybe my aunt wouldn't like it. Interestingly enough there is only one door in and one door out of the dining room. Looks like it was built before more strict fire codes.   If its past 10pm in this general Stanford area Gotts and closed and overall still happy to have this as an option. I think the gas station next door brings in some shady people though. Just a short ride from Stanford its a different world.,*I order a sourdough grilled chicken and curly fries with drink. *Food is good - standard Jack and was prepared quickly. *Fries super fresh even though it looked so slow that night.,* Ordered sourdough grilled chicken with curly fries and a drink * Food was good and prepared quickly * Fries were fresh despite a slow night, , 
18,"Currently here, and have been waiting for almost 30 minutes with two or maybe three cars in front of me.  I forgot my lunch so I needed to buy something for lunch and this is ridiculous.  I've never been to a fast food place where it's not fast.",No relevant information found., , ,

20, , , , ,"There are mixed reviews regarding the food at Jack in the Box. Some customers had a positive experience with their orders, stating that the food was hot, fresh, and perfect. However, many reviews express disappointment with the food, particularly with its consistency and taste. Some examples include overcooked and cold hash browns, unsatisfactory breakfast sandwiches, flavorless burgers, and soggy hash browns. While the tacos were praised, other items were criticized for missing patties, having only half of the advertised portion, and not being as advertised. Some reviews commented on the high prices for food that did not meet their expectations, such as croissant-shaped bread that was not flaky and tasted like regular bread. However, some customers who ordered to go had a better experience after reheating their burgers in the oven. There were also complaints about the excessive lettuce added to the burgers and incorrect orders. Overall, the reviews suggest mixed experiences with Jack in the Box's food."
