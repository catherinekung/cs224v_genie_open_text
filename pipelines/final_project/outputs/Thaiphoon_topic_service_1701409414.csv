0,"Came with friends for Friday dinner and were seated immediately. The interior is nice and warm, and felt comfortable. Menu price range is generally typical for downtown Palo Alto. However, note that the entree orders don't come with rice, and a bowl of white rice or brown rice costs $2.75 which felt rather high especially as other restaurants often include rice along with the dish.  Food came out quickly. The flavors of our dishes were pretty good. However, I was a bit underwhelmed by the Eggplant with Spicy Sauce, which turned out to be mostly mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers with only a few pieces of eggplant. We did quite like the taste of the yellow curry though, and I've also enjoyed their green curry when having it in the past.",No relevant information found., , , 
1,"Came here on a Friday night in a group of 6, and was seated immediately.   We ordered a large sample off the menu, here were the highlights:  - Pineapple fried rice: very tasty. Rice is cooked perfectly, each grain holds up on its own, and the flavors and pineapple add a nice spicy sweetness.  - Shaken beef: Portion size is a bit smaller, but the flavor and texture of the beef is top tier.  - Roti and Curry sauce: who doesn't like super crispy bread with flavorful dipping sauces!? Must get as an appetizer.  - Tapioca and Fresh Mango: you gotta end with this one! So warm and comforting, but not overly sweet. Of course only makes sense if mangos are in season.   I also tried the yellow curry chicken with mango, but I think the mango in the curry dish added too much sweetness and didn't help brighten the flavor like I'd hoped. But maybe their regular curries are good.   Service was great as well. We were making quite a lot of requests to our servers and they fulfilled everything very timely.","*Came here on a Friday night in a group of 6, and was seated immediately. *Service was great as well. *We were making quite a lot of requests to our servers and they fulfilled everything very timely.",* Seated immediately on Friday night in a group of 6 * Great service * Prompt fulfillment of requests made to servers, , 
2,"My husband and I were actually supposed to eat somewhere else, but we stumbled upon this restaurant instead! The cocktails we ordered were very tasty and refreshing. Since I have a peanut allergy, our server was very kind and was able to accommodate me by ensuring peanuts on the Pad Thai would be on the side. When it came to the Satay Chicken, the chicken itself had so much flavor that I was ok with being unable to have the peanut sauce. It paired really well with the cucumber salad it was served with. I really don't think this place deserves anything below 4-5 stars. It's a bit on the pricier side, but the portions are generous and you truly get what you pay for. I'd love to come again and try the other items on their menu.",*our server was very kind and was able to accommodate me by ensuring peanuts on the Pad Thai would be on the side.,* Kind server who accommodated customer's request * Peanuts on Pad Thai served on the side as requested, ,

4,"What a wonderful place. Food is amazing. Service is so courteous and thoughtful. I always have amazing time when I come here. It a romantic date or a family dinner, Thaiphoon is always a great place to spend an evening and have a delicious meal. My friend and I are vegetarians and they are also very happy to accommodate us in our needs. Cannot recommend this place enough.",*Service is so courteous and thoughtful *they are also very happy to accommodate us in our needs.,* Courteous and thoughtful service * Willingness to accommodate customers' needs, , 
5,"Overall:  Solid. One element of each dish was slightly over-cooked and/or missing. Would get them both again to give them another shot.   Lemongrass Chicken (3/5): Really good flavor.  Chicken slightly over-cooked, making it chewy.   Pad See Ew (3/5): Same as above. Good  flavor, noodles a bit over-cooked. Lacking adequate sauce.",No relevant information found., , ,

10,The service was great and the food is mediocre for Thai food. The shrimp pad Thai was sweet and the noodles were thin like angel hair which I am not used to. I liked my crispy tofu with cashews and the mango sticky rice was good. I really enjoyed the tapioca pudding for dessert.,*the service was great,* Great service, , 
11,"We first of all, got seated pretty quickly on a Wednesday night. It was a chilly night and we were seated outside but the heaters were great and we felt nothing but comfortable. We ordered 2 starters: Golden eggplant and the roti curry sauce. The eggplant was good but not amazing but that could be personal preference. The roti and both sauces were extremely tasty but the size of the roti was small. For main courses we ordered the green curry with tofu and vegetables and pad ke mao. Both were very tasty, the rice was extra and doesn't come with the curry. Overall we enjoyed this experience. This place is slightly pricey but overall fairly worth it.",No relevant information found., , , 
12,"I have been here a couple times before and found food and service acceptable. Not great, but completely respectable pad thai and other standard Thai stuff. Last time it was pretty bad. Noddle dishes were extremely salty - so much salt that it killed any other flavor. in contrast, soups were so bland that they tasted like hot water and little else. My drink was unacceptable. I was in the mood for a cocktail and ordered an old fashioned (my bad - old fashioned in a Thai restaurant) and it was frankly the worst mixed drink I've had in my entire life: a red concoction with no bourbon at all, crushed ice, and lime?! Service was so mediocre, our server did not pay any attention to us except for glaring at us as we paid and selected tip in the ipad. Alas, not returning.",*Service was so mediocre *server did not pay any attention to us except for glaring at us as we paid and selected tip in the ipad.,* Mediocre service * Server did not pay attention except for glaring at the user during payment and tip selection on iPad, ,

14,"I came here for a work dinner and we all were blown away. The service was fast and friendly. We were able to be seated right away. The interior had a cool vibe. Everyone absolutely loved their food choices. The drink menu included a variety or beer, wine and cocktails. I will definitely be eating here in the future!",*The service was fast and friendly *We were able to be seated right away,* Fast and friendly service * No wait time for seating, ,

17,"I've ordered here a few times for delivery and thought this place was just OK each time. Here's what we got recently:  Yellow curry with chicken and potatoes: flavor is pretty good. I was not super impressed with the chicken though since the pieces were quite dry. I liked the potatoes!  Pad see ew with chicken: same problem, chicken breast was pretty dry. Flavor is decent although not the best pad see ew I've had.   Vegetable stir fry: ugh this dish was $14 and they barely gave you anything. It was also mostly string beans and bean sprouts (I hate bean sprouts). This was absolutely not worth it!  Beef with basil: beef was tough again and I thought the flavor was just OK. I find tough beef especially difficult to eat.",No relevant information found., , , 
18,"Take out review. Pad Thai. Coconut soup and green curry. Really want this to be good, but it's not. The pad Thai is a MAJOR disappointment. I don't have a high standard for pad Thai but this was dry garbage. Some loose noodles and some shrimp.no other ingredients. It should be a Sunday major side. But instead was a major disappointment.",No relevant information found., , , 
19,"Impromptu Thai food is the best way to satiate that Thai food craving and Thaiphoon definitely hit the mark! We ordered through doordash and our meal came very quickly.   #Fried egg rolls (veggie) -- These were delicious! They were still hot and crispy when we received them, and the sweet and spicy sauce was perfect.   #Green papaya salad -- comes with a decent amount of papaya salad and 3 huge shrimp. Very tasty!  #Pad Thai noodles -- your classic pad Thai. Nothing crazy special. Flavors were what you'd expect and the noods were the perfect springy texture.   #Panang tofu curry -- delicious and creamy! Definitely a hit. They give a lot of tofu, which is nice.   All in all a solid Thai food experience for those nights you have that craving. Will definitely be ordering from them again!",*We ordered through doordash and our meal came very quickly.,* Fast delivery via Doordash, ,

The prompt fulfillment of requests and good table service were also mentioned by several customers. There were a few negative reviews, with some mentioning long wait times due to understaffing. One review criticized the server's mediocre service and lack of attention during payment. However, overall, Thaiphoon seems to provide excellent service to their customers, whether it be in person or via delivery services such as Doordash."
