0,"Wait, what? Yeah. I wrote a one star here a while back. They made a mistake and I've since learned to lighten up when bad stuff happens! Ya gotta cool off a bit before you start! This Weinerschnitzle location has always been my favorite due to the location, staff, and then there's the one of a kind menu! They make their fries to order so you won't be getting limp, lifeless, cool fries. No, you get smokin hot French fries to go with that smokin hot Chilli cheese dog! Five stars, can't miss, I gotta have it once a week!","*One of a kind menu *Fries made to order, not limp, lifeless, or cool.", 
1,Mexican lady working drive thru is hella rude. The yelled at me for asking for a water cup. She demanded a tip for the \, , 
2,"This is the closest Weinerschnitzel location to me. The food is doable on certain days and it's a complete miss on others.  Quality control and quality as a whole is nonexistent so come here at your own risk.  The only item I come here for are the Chili Cheese Fries and my cravings usually aren't satisfied. There is usually at least one issue regarding stale fries, unmelted cheese, and|or the orders are made half a**.  FYI- keep an eye out for coupons in the mail. The food isn't worth paying full price!!", , 
3,Don't order the pretzel bun dog with cheese. You get a pretzel bun and a side of cheese no dog. Been ordering this for years. First time I've had no dog in it. Went back through the drive thru only to be told we got what we ordered a pretzel bun with cheese. Ummm no I ordered a pretzel bun DOG with cheese. Then opened the cheese only to have plastic in it. Terrible, , 
4,"Only good thing bout this place is the milkshakes! Please don't waste your money on the chili cheese fries/burgers/hotdogs, after taste, tastes like it's been placed in dirty water. The fries was not crispy or cooked, the chili tasted watered down, & the cheese was like plastic. Good customer service tho", , 
5,I am scared to go here again after I watched someone pick up a French fry  from the floor they dropped and put it back in the fryer.  John, , 
6,"Kinda sucks that this is the closest Weinerschnitzel to where i'm currently living at.  I've been coming here on and off for years.  Over the years the pricing has gone up and the quality has gone down.  I used to come here regularly (about 4x / month) and got to know the workers and assistant managers.  It was to the point where they would hook me up with coupon prices even if I didnt have the coupon.     Nowadays, if you dont have a coupon, you're paying full price.  And like the previous Yelper said, the food is not worth paying full price for.", , 
7,"I found two transparent white black larvae floating around my later soda cup filled with lemonade many hours ago. The first one I found was when I filled my second cup at the soda machine, so I dumped it out and refilled it again but when I got to school at around 2:45 PM. I found another thinner transparent white black floating around my lemonade drink so I dumped it out again, please consider having a soda machine repairs man to come by and clean the machine. It can be very hazardous! But overall the food is very good, as always.",*Found two transparent white black larvae floating around the drink *Food is very good, 
8,"I guess compared to the other reviews I got lucky today. I ordered a corndog, small fries, and Mug rootbeer. Ordering was quick and efficient. The corndog was fresh tasting. The cornbread coating was slightly sweet with distinct corn taste. The hotdog had a slight snap to it as I bit into it. Overall I was pleased with my corndog experience. The fries were awesome. Very hot, and slightly crispy. They were not oily, and reminded me of Micky D's back in the day when they could make killer fries. The rootbeer was cold, crisp, and refreshing. I took this snack to go so I can't really comment on dining in. I was happy with my choices and would choose to do this again.","*Corndog was fresh tasting with slightly sweet cornbread coating and distinct corn taste *Fries were awesome - hot, slightly crispy, not oily and reminiscent of Micky D's fries *Rootbeer was cold, crisp and refreshing", 
9,I ordered 3 chili fries and drove home 2 find out the fries are stale. I call and they keep hanging up on me. On going 2maro 2see a manager and get my $ back. SMH., , 
10, , ,"Based on the reviews, the food at Weinerschnitzel seems to have mixed sentiments. Some customers praised the one of a kind menu and enjoyed the taste of the food, particularly the corndog which had a distinct corn taste and was fresh. The fries were also well-received by customers, as they were made to order and not limp or cool. On the other hand, one customer found two transparent black larvae floating in their drink, which can be concerning. Overall, it seems that Weinerschnitzel has some delicious options on their menu, but issues with cleanliness and quality control may need to be addressed."
