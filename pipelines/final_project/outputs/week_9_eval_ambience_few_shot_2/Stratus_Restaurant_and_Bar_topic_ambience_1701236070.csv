0,"This was a cocktail pre-game before a dinner date. It is a hotel bar, which is not a bad thing and we liked it.  Nice service, average selections on liquor but it was a really nice place if you want to meet up with people as the environment is a hotel lounge-y type place. Bar seating as well.  I recommend for work meetings, low-key day drinking, even sports watching if you just want to have a second to breathe away from your home.","*Nice service *Nice place if you want to meet up with people *Environment is a hotel lounge-y type place *Bar seating *I recommend for work meetings, low-key day drinking, even sports watching if you just want to have a second to breathe away from your home.", 
1,"Your basic hotel restaurant, offering a reasonable menu. Decent quality and service, and pricing.", , 
2,"New area. New Holiday Inn. Small restaurant in the lobby of a nice hotel. (Holiday Inn)  Drinks were awesome. Juan our bartender & server was great. Because of Mr M's recent injury we didn't go up to the rooftop area which they said was great. But the restaurant and bar are not quite finished. So We will return to check it out...  The fish tacos were undercooked and too bland for me, Mr M liked them okay... They took way too long due to the cook calling in sick, they needed to get someone else in the kitchen. Will return to try other items on the menu, hopefully on the rooftop!","*Drinks were awesome *Fish tacos were undercooked and too bland for me, Mr M liked them okay *Took way too long due to the cook calling in sick, they needed to get someone else in the kitchen *Will return to try other items on the menu, hopefully on the rooftop", 
3,Nice place! Location is close to the hotel I stayed. I ordered the sandwich and fries. Fries are perfect made! Sandwich is a little bit dry. I'm not a big fan of that. The environment is very cozy and welcoming. Overall it's a very good experience!,*Fries are perfect made *Sandwich is a little bit dry *Environment is very cozy and welcoming, 
4,We celebrated my father in law's milestone birthday party here. Location is a gem. I haven't seen any other roof top venues around the areA. Party started a little before sunset and the ambiance got better as sun started going down. Service and food was unparalleled. All the guests kept taking about the place. We were ~40 people. We didn't need but it has banquet halls. It can accommodate rooms for outside guests since downstairs is holiday inn. We have stayed in many holiday inns but this is very good with service and decor. Most convenient for silicon valley locations.  I will definitely come back in future  either as hosts as guests.,*Location is a gem *Ambiance got better as sun started going down *Service and food was unparalleled *All the guests kept talking about the place *Holiday Inn downstairs is very good with service and decor *Most convenient for Silicon Valley locations, 
5,Very convenient restaurant / bar located just off the lobby of a relative new and nicely appointed Holiday Inn just off Dixon Landing Road area of Milpitas.  I always add \, , 
6,I ate here twice and I recommend you try the chicken ceaser salad and the chicken queso.   It was very tasty!, , 
7,Service is excellent and food and drinks are good but it should be noted that this is in the lobby of a hotel! This is probably the reason it's a tad pricey. They have a rooftop which is actually very nice and faces the sunset.,*Service is excellent *Food and drinks are good *Located in the lobby of a hotel *Rooftop facing sunset is nice., 
8,"Hoping this place would be better but was very disappointed. It's a restaurant located in the lobby of holiday inn. First, the bartender/server didn't even greet us or look at us for over 5 minutes (besides one other table of 2, we are the only ones there) and continued to act like he was afraid to come to the table or serve us. He was nice but we just didn't feel welcomed. Then they didn't have any olives or olive juice for dirty martinis which is weird but whatever I ordered something else. The thing that really got me is I ordered the skirt steak and it was served with green beans that were frozen or old and INSTANT MASHED POTATOES! (I've eaten them many times in my life so I knew instantly) Not to mention one shot of Jameson was $18...won't be going back again. Hope they could get their act together because the bar and eating area was pretty nice.  P.s. only thing that was good was the chicken Caesar salad. 1 star for the salad and 1 star for the nice bar",*Did not feel welcomed by bartender/server *Skirt steak was served with old or frozen green beans and instant mashed potatoes *One shot of Jameson was $18 *The only thing that was good was the chicken Caesar salad., 
9,"So they just opened everyone. Not only is the restaurant beautiful but so is the entire facility. They did a wonderful job putting it together. I could only imagine how many of these neighboring companies are gonna stop by for a quick bite or a tasty cocktail after a long day. The menu isn't too big yet not too small either. Just enough for everyone to find everything they're craving. The liquor selection is enormous and they have a few nice beers on draft. The food comes quickly and drinks are all very pretty. I definitely recommend stopping by if you're near Dixon Landing. A new add to the city of  Milpitas, especially if you're looking for quality ingredients prepared honestly and sold affordable. I'm coming back",*restaurant is beautiful *facility is beautiful *menu isn't too big yet not too small *liquor selection is enormous *food comes quickly *quality ingredients prepared honestly and sold affordable *I definitely recommend stopping by, 
10,This breakfast was made perfectly!!! So fluffy and the hashbrowns were delicious. I would recommend this restaurant even if you are not staying at the hotel. They also have amazing dinner entrees!, ,

Many customers enjoyed the service and atmosphere of the restaurant, describing it as warm, inviting, and cozy. The location of the restaurant was also praised for being convenient and for having a nice rooftop view. However, some reviews mentioned negative experiences with the food, such as undercooked fish tacos or a dry sandwich. The price of some items was also mentioned as being high, such as the $18 shot of Jameson. Overall, the majority of reviews were positive, recommending the restaurant for work meetings, low-key day drinking, and even sports watching."
