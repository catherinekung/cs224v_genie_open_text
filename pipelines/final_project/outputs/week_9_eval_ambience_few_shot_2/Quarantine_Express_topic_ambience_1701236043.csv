0,"I love the creativity.  I found this place whilst scrolling through IG and knew I had to try it.  I'll be honest that I wasn't a fan of the noodles inside the quesadilla but I will say that it tasted very much like pho w/ the addition of the tortilla.    The BBH burrito blew my mind on the other hand.  This was spicy and the broth that came w/ it acted like a dipping sauce but it didn't need it.  The burrito wasn't dry - tasted bomb on its own.  I will come back to order 5 of these.    BTW - word has it that they have tamales now!  Check this place out on IG and try it for yourself.  Now more than ever it's important to not only eat well, be happy, and support local businesses!",*Creativity is appreciated *Wasn't a fan of the noodles inside the quesadilla *BBH burrito blew their mind *Burrito was spicy *Broth that came with it acted like a dipping sauce *Burrito wasn't dry *Tasted bomb on its own *Will come back to order 5 of these *Word has it they have tamales now, 
1,"Food is fine, but they are just super unprofessional.   First, they called and said they had to cancel our BBH burrito because they messed up on the rice. Ok, sure.. no big deal.
