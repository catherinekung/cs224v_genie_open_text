4,"Well, I came here not reading any of the reviews, which I regret. The food was mediocre or better said not worth it. The micheladas were a TOTAL disappointment.

5,"Came in today for an early dinner. First time here. Ordered the breaded fish fillet platter and the molcajete de Mariacos. The presentation of their dishes and drinks are appetizing and look really delicious, however, for my taste it was a bit lacking. This is just my opinion, the food needed to be better seasoned and needed salt. The fish in the molcajete was a bit fishy tasting and the shrimp needed some salt. Maybe it's an off day for them, who knows, will give them another try in the future.",Bullet points: - Food quality was lacking for the user's taste. - Opinion that the food needed better seasoning and salt. - Fish in the molcajete dish had a fishy taste. - Shrimp dish needed more salt.,

7,"Make sure to check your receipt they will add things you didn't order. They will add a tip, which isn't the problem but how does 30 dollar tip make sense on a 118 dollar tab. They will tax you twice and their explanation doesn't even make sense. BE AWARE!!!", ,

14,"If I was able to give it zero stars I would. Food was all brought out for our party except one dish, waited another 25 minutes before getting the plate. Once we were done we received the check with a tip of 50% instead of 15%. We told the waitress and she said it was correct it was 15% and that's how the restaurant works. I then showed her what 15% was, her face dropped. Food is okay, service is horrible.",Bullet points: - Food quality is okay., 
15,"WORST PLACE EVER!!!! customer service sucks food took forever, waitress spilled my drink, the added a $50 tip without my husband's acknowledgement then when he checked the card statement they took more than what they stated on the bill slip. Then they blamed it on the store next to them stating that the waffles took the card. I do not trust these people they did not give me 0 explanation to the issue. They stated that the tip was automatically put on the bill but we did not want to leave a tip due to the worst service i have ever had. THEY ARE SCAMMING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR MONEY.", ,

You then take my order and prepare the pool table per my request however you take your time getting my food out, and then give the table away to other people. I ordered the fajitas which was as fresh as a microwaveable hungryman...  And I woulda preferred one of those.

Never coming back.",Bullet points: - Fajitas were not fresh. - The user would have preferred a microwaveable Hungry Man meal.,
