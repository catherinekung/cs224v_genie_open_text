1,"Unfortunately very disappointed. The price was not worth it.  We happened to be in the mood for tacos and decided to be adventurous, and didn't even look at reviews ('gasp' omg) just went to the 1st taco truck we saw. We got our order to go, they pack onions and cilantro and lemons in a Ziploc which was cool. However I'm gonna go ahead and assume that the main upside to this place is that their tortillas are handmade, which I guess is a plus? However, my bf didn't even get the right order he got different meats and they were all just asada. Don't even get me started on what they call a quesadilla, it was the saddest thing I ever did see... And looked exactly like a freaking taco. Everything was more tortilla than anything, barely any meat and lacked flavor. Personally, I will not be coming back.", , 
2,"Food was so good. I ordered menudo, it was one of the best menudos I had. My husband ordered Birria and its was delicious. Most plates are served with home made tortillas. The staff is so friendly.","*Ordered menudo, it was one of the best menudos I had *Husband ordered Birria and it was delicious *Most plates are served with homemade tortillas",

4,"I'm not one to complain but these were the worst tacos I have ever had. Tortilla was cold, barely any meat, no cilantro , lime, flavorless. One of the tacos meat also tasted odd. $18 for 5 flavorless/ barely any meat tacos is not worth it to me. Really disappointing.","*Tortilla was cold *Barely any meat *No cilantro, lime, flavorless *One of the tacos meat also tasted odd *Flavorless/barely any meat tacos", 
5,"food was amazing. definitely can tell everything is made from scratch. very delicious consume and the al pastor was very tender. the quesabirria was very big and filled me up quickly. their salsas are very good as well. great atmosphere and such a sweet family owned business. very welcoming, would recommend and come again soon :) time to knock out from a food coma from how good the food was.",*food was amazing *everything is made from scratch *very delicious consume and al pastor *quesabirria was big and filled reviewer up quickly *salsas are very good, 
6,"my friend paid with a 100$ bill and they tried to say it was a 50$ bill instead, the tacos were not fried the way they said, nor did they have cilantro or cebolla on them. really disappointing   mi amigo pago con un billete de 100 y trataron de decir que era uno de 50$, los tacos no estaban dorados ni traían cebolla ó cilantro ;(   bien decepcionada ;(", , 
7,"Tried for first time, to start cashier was rude not just to me to other customers also. Customers would ask questions and just like she was bothered. A man came back saying my order was wrong and she said no the way you asked for your food he was going back and forth making the man feel dumb. Anyway food was dry after them also getting my order wrong she also told me I ordered wrong when it was just a taco de birria and taco de lengua both squishy, regardless my first and last time not only service was bad but food was dry and flavorless.", , 
8,"Just delicious, everything is homemade . Very nice and clean , the owners are very nice!","*Just delicious, everything is homemade", 
9,Cash and Venmo is accepted. Quesobirria tacos were great! Only downside is to-go orders you don't get the consume (soup). I believe if you eat there then you are given the soup with the quesobirria tacos. Wait time was around 10-15 minutes after ordering. Staff was friendly and saw that they were hand making their tortillas which makes it taste even better :) Parking is limited. Would definitely come again!!,*Quesobirria tacos were great *Hand made tortillas made it taste even better, 
10, , ,"It seems that the reviews for the food quality at La Tradición De Nueva Italia are overall positive. Customers praised the menudo, birria, and quesabirria for being very delicious and made from scratch. The restaurant is also known for serving homemade tortillas with most plates. However, some reviewers mentioned that the tacos were flavorless and had barely any meat. Despite these negative reviews, many customers still enjoyed the food and found it to be delicious and homemade. Overall, the sentiment towards the food quality at La Tradición De Nueva Italia is positive."
