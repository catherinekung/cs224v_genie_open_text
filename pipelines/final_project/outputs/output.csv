0,Brittany and Nicole were so kind to us and took excellent care of us preparing our delicious pizzas Thanks and blessings  Mel & Frieda, 
1,"I was craving a salad for lunch and decided to order from MOD pizza. I'm sure a pizza place isn't the first thing that comes to your mind when you're craving a salad, but trust me! This place is amazing.  I left a review a month ago but they changed their salad container to a much larger one! Figured that was worth an updated review. The new containers are huge and they give you two dressings now. It's fully loaded too and not just lettuce. So happy they made this change!", 
2,"Convenient spot for me, next to Habit Burger and just across from Pruneyard. They offer points in their app and have rewards from time to time, which makes it a better deal. There's always someone new working when I go here but haven't had an issue with my pizza. It can get busy around dinner time but they move pretty quickly. Good size parking lot and tons of tables inside.",Bullet points: - Offers points in their app. - Rewards available from time to time. - Makes it a better deal.
3,"I absolutely love this MOD pizza location. They're friendly, considerate, clean, and have great food quality. They never complain about how many toppings I ask for...they just make sure we're taken care of. They are not only kind with their customers, but with their coworkers as well. It's just a nice atmosphere overall plus amazing food!", 
4,"Came here after door dash delivered the wrong order to my house and there were grossly understaffed.  It took 35 minutes to order, online orders come before people in line.  My daughters pizza was burnt, they did offer to remake it but we felt too guilty with how understaffed they were to take the offer.  I will order online from now on now that I know you can skip the line that way.  They ran out of a ton of toppings and had to keep restocking when they were busy,", 
5,"I love going to MOD Pizza with all their toppings you can get galore with one set price! They even have a vegan cheese with some vegan sausage options too!! I was more shocked that they had a new dessert for the season!! Granted I am now gluten-free, I can't eat it but goodness it looks delicious! I wish they had a gluten-free dessert, but I know that would be another specialty item. I'm happy they have a great cauliflower crust that is almost bowl shaped and holds in all of my vegetables I get on my pizza! I will definitely be back later this week!!",Bullet points: - MOD Pizza has a set price for all toppings. - The user loves going to MOD Pizza.
6,"The 5 stars are for the two people that stood out to me during my last trip to Mod Pizza in Campbell (on 4/2/23).  There was a tall, Caucasian gentleman with glasses who made me the best pizza ever (honestly, I rarely eat at Mod but this pizza was great, toppings were good, cooked just right).  Then there was another, shorter Caucasian gentleman with piercing blue eyes, the sweetest smile and a blue bandana wrapped around his head.  As my daughter and I ate our pizza we became aware that the manager (seemed like a manager?) was sitting next to us and writing these workers up.  I was really sad and almost said something.  First of all I am wondering why the manager did this in front of customers, for all of us very clearly to hear.  He was explaining to the taller guy that he used too many toppings and that it was not good for the business. He told him he had to sign the write up, and the man seemed confused and ended up signing.  Just FYI, and I was telling my daughter this too because I want this to be a lesson to her.  Good managers respect their workers and build them up.  There was no \", 
7,Pizza was uncooked. Upset had higher expectations considering all the good reviews. Domino's would gave been better, 
8,"Whenever I visit my family on this side of the bay area, and we feel like pizza, we all enjoy going to this restaurant. The servings are made exactly for you, with the options to have something smaller or larger. They are fast, efficient, and quite humorous in the way that they communicate with one another. I love that they have plant-based options which include alternative cheese, and plant-based sausages. They have a wide array of drinks from the fountain or bottle and canned. If you are on this side of the bay area and you were looking for pizza but you don't wanna pay for anything cheap and you don't want to pay for more than you're going to eat in one sitting, consider this establishment. Fresh ingredients, fresh dough, fresh take on an American favorite.",Bullet points: - Affordable pizza restaurant in the bay area. - Portions are reasonable and not too large. - Good option for those who want to avoid cheap food.
9,This place is so filthy!!! I came on a Sunday night. 7:28pm august 7th 2022 and everything was just so gross. First time at this location and always go to the one on cherry. I didn't want to take pics of the employees while they made the pizza but it was soooo dirty where all the toppings are and the floor had food all over. Definitely won't be coming back to this location., 
10,"I have no gripes with the pizza, but the service is consistently horrible at this location. Tonight they made 2 out of 3 pizzas ordered online (which were ready when I walked in the door), but then forgot about the third. When I finally asked about the status, a woman said that in person orders took precedence, except I had been sitting in the place for so long, I knew there were no in person orders and that she was lying. So frustrating.  Edit to add: I forgot to note that twice they very politely (the young man making the pizzas was working very diligently) tried to give me the wrong pizza.", 
11,"Came and ordered online for Bagby dinner night where proceeds go to the school. Could not enter the code when I ordered the food. When I got there, the food was ready on time but I told the person that I couldn't enter the code to help credit the school. The guy said I don't know and pretty much ignored me a bit.   I went to my car and got the announcements and showed it to him and I guess someone else's who was in charge. They stated they didn't know about it and that they have been told these things for the last few months. I just the reason why I came here was for the school and told them that they need to deal with it and figure it out. Not sure if they called the manage but I left with my food.   Kids loved their food but they messed up my order.   I just got a pepperoni pizza with no toppings, I was the only pizza out of 5 that was incorrect. I guess next time spot check your orders.  Everyone else is enjoying their pizza but I feel disapointed since this was a good cause and my pizza was not correct.", 
12,"Loved the crust on my pizza!! Crunchy and just thick enough to not end up with too much carbs!  Load it up with whatever veggie you want that day and make it a salad on a pizza. Pretty satisfying and a lot healthier than the usual pizza.  I always top my pizza with a spicy sauce to kick it up a notch, or just use as a dip if you are taking to-go!  Just", 
13,"The pizza is great, but do not order online anytime that you think it might be busy. My two personal pizza are still not ready an HOUR after the designated pick up time.   I watched as all the people in the long in-store line ordered, got their pizzas, ate and left, while I have been sitting and waiting for my order to be made.", 
14,"Ordered from here (and eaten at the spot) multiple times - most recent experience was no different. It's just ok if you're in a rush, or on a quick lunch-break and want a reasonably-priced, filling meal.   General: it is a bit of a cookie-cutter fast-food pizza experience, i.e. convenient, consistent, moderately-priced and enough variety that there's a little something for everyone.   Pros: The main thing is that you can customize your pizza and that they are quite generous (perhaps a bit too much) with the toppings - you can add as much of anything you like. Ditto with their salads - for $11.95, you'll come away with something heavier than a bookshelf if you want... and their standard menu has a few good ingredient combos if you don't want to come up with your own salad or pizza-topping list.   Nice touch: their drink list is actually better than most spots (includes Mexican coke, flavoured San Pellegrino soda, Boylans soda) and have a nice little \","Bullet points: - Reasonably-priced, filling meal for those in a rush or on a quick lunch break - Moderately-priced with variety for everyone - $11."
15,Terrible. Ordered 2 pizzas got 1 after about 30 minutes of waiting the lost my pizza some how asked me to wait back in line. I already paid why would I wait in lime again. Asked for a refund and was told by employee that he can't give me a refund because no one there knew how to. So was told to call in morning for refund makes no sense. Went in 10.23.22 around 6pm, 
16,I've had Blaze and that is decent. This place. I'd rather not say but one star says it all. Ingredients and taste were horrendous. I was very disappointed. I can see why there aren't many of these establishments around, 
17,"I ordered online so I could skip waiting on the pizza in person. This was a very efficient process. The pizza looked a little more blackened than I would like. However, I'm overall a fan because you literally pick the ingredients you want! How could you dislike your own choices of toppings? They don't really limit each category, you could go crazy and get 8+ sauces, cheeses and toppings on your pizzas. I ordered an 11\", 
18,"Once again I try and give this place a second chance and they prove me right for staying away. Went on a Friday night, line o was about 10-12 people deep. No issue, I'll wait my turn, but once i finally go to the front, it had been 20 something minutes. then once I get to the front, all 3-4 people start making all the phone orders. I get that there's phone orders, but what about the people standing in front of you? So I wait another 10-15 minutes, get my pizza made, and then no one is at the register to pay, another wait for someone. I felt like just walking away and getting my pizza for free to go. After I get my pizza, I asked for ranch and the dude squirts ranch that poured out like milk, he's just like, \", 
19,"They need to stop advertising that they offer curbside. I've been here twice and they're so short handed they haven't brought it out. Then, when I walked in to pick up my order, they hadn't even started it. I know they may not have enough employees, but the need to make changes somewhere.",
