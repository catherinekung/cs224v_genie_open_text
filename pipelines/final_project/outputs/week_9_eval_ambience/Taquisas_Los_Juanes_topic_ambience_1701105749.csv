1,"On August 2018, Juan and his team fed 100 hungry people on my daughter's birthday party. I was able to choose four (4) different meats (Asada, Chorizo con Papa, Pastor & Chicken) plus the Salsas, Aguas Frescas, rice, beans, etc....All were delicious! I was delighted with their service, food quality, taste, and professionalism. I will hire Taquisas Los Juanes for future needs for sure! Recommended 100%", ,

3,"I hired Los Juanes for a birthday party a few weeks back and the food was delicious! The staff is very professional yet fun at the same time. They are also very clean which is a huge deal for me. I was a little nervous to hire them because they had just started up not too long ago but I have no regrets. I loved how they had a variety of different items that they offer, not just tacos. I will definitely hire them again!", ,
