0,We Love Lunch at The Creek!  Expect: A Perfect sized menu with superb dining options.  We loved the Salad and Pizza Combo Lunch - the thin crust pizza was divine...and the Cesare Salad was terrific. Our handsome waiter was cordial and and welcoming. We made plans to return before we finished our meal!  Huge Bar in the Back!  Happy to have discovered this neighborhood dining/drinking establishment.,*Superb dining options *Thin crust pizza was divine *Cesare salad was terrific *Cordial and welcoming waiter *Huge bar in the back, 
1,"Came here for the second time for an early dinner. We were seated right away on the back patio. They have heat lamps and cute tables in the back, it's a nice atmosphere. Service was alright both times - staff is nice but forget to check on you. Tonight, they were out of literally half of the beers on their menu which was a bit disappointing.   They have pizza, salads, pastas, etc. The menu offers a bit of something for everyone. The food here is just ok. It all tastes a bit bland and lacks flavor. Tonight we had: *Meatballs app- 5/5 good flavor served in a red sauces with toasted bread  *Caesar salad with chicken. 3/5 This was pretty bland and the chicken tasted like a frozen patty from Costco with the imitation sear marks on it.  *Shrimp Alfredo 3/5. This is a generous portion, but it was an odd combination. Shrimp, noodles, boiled carrots, broccoli slathered in a sweet Alfredo.   Overall, it's a cute restaurant with a good vibe, but the food was just ok.",*Seated right away on the back patio *Nice atmosphere *Food tastes bland and lacks flavor *Meatballs app- 5/5 good flavor served in a red sauce with toasted bread, 
2,Came here for my niece's birthday. The indoors have a cute rustic feel and a very nice outdoor seating layout.  The servers were attentive and accommodating. The food and drinks were satisfying. The pastas were good portions. Old fashioned were just as good.  A place I would come back to when in the area.,*Indoor has a cute rustic feel and a very nice outdoor seating layout *Servers were attentive and accommodating *Food and drinks were satisfying *Pastas were good portions *Old fashioned were just as good *A place to come back to when in the area, 
3,"I went during the day time, and it was pretty much empty. I kind of liked it though because it was very peaceful. It was nice weather too so we sat outside. Service was great. Our server was kind and quick with our requests. The food came out fast too, but probably because there weren't a lot of people.  Meatballs: 4/5, the meatballs were good with the bread Calamari: 3/5, the calamari was good but it was a bit too pale for my liking. I wanted it to be more burnt  Caesar Salad: 4/5, just a basic caesar salad, can't go wrong with that lol Hoggin It Pizza: 3.5/5, this pizza was okay, I didn't really enjoy the crust but the ranch made it better","*Empty during the day time, but peaceful *Service was great, server was kind and quick *Food came out fast *Meatballs: 4/5 *Caesar Salad: 4/5 *Hoggin It Pizza: 3.", 
4,"This restaurant is located near Evergreen in a really nice and peaceful plaza. I've always driven past this plaza but I've never gone inside to check out the businesses here. My friend actually took me here and I was quite surprised by how delicious the food was! We came here at around 4 PM on a Friday and it wasn't busy whatsoever.  What we ordered:   Hoggin it pizza: 3.9/5 This pizza was pretty delicious and very similar to a pepperoni pizza but much more elevated. The crust was perfectly fluffy and the pizza was also thin but had a nice crunch. However, it was a bit too salty for me.  The forest pizza: 5/5 I absolutely enjoy mushrooms and spinach on my pizza as it's not too heavy at all. This one definitely stood out to me and was SO delicious!! Again, the crust and the thin dough were so perfect. I'll definitely order this again.  Lamb Skewers: 5/5 I don't normally order lamb as it's a hit or miss for me because of the grass taste and the dryness of the meat. However, the lamb skewers were crazy good. They were juicy and flavorful along with the grilled grapes that came with it as well. The grapes added a slight sweetness to the lamb and it was the perfect combo!  I also ordered myself a peach alcoholic drink but unfortunately, I cannot remember what it was called. It was really delicious though!  Overall, this is an amazing spot to come and chill with friends! The food and drinks are delicious and the atmosphere is great.","*This restaurant is located in a really nice and peaceful plaza *Hoggin it pizza: 3.9/5 *The forest pizza: 5/5 *Lamb Skewers: 5/5 *I also ordered myself a peach alcoholic drink but unfortunately, I cannot remember what it was called.

5,"I live about 8 minutes from here so I've been curious for months about this place. Okay so before deciding to try it, I called in inquiring what type of veggie patty their plant based burger uses because I have food sensitivities and I'm Veg. The host was sooo distracted while having me on the call that he made me repeat my question THREE times!! And when he finally listened to my question he responded with \", , 
6,Delicious.  I ordered the baked fennel sausage rigatoni and it was wonderful. I was a little disappointed that I had to salt it but that is just a taste preference. If they want me to be a regular add a garlic cheesy bread to the menu. I will definitely add this place to my restaurant rotation., , 
7,"The cake that Daphne made for my daughter's birthday was perfect!  It was moist, not too sweet and so delicious.  She was very responsive and helpful to all my questions. I'd definitely refer her to my friends and family.", , 
8,"Have been here a few times with friends/coworkers for happy hour. Get the Brussel Sprouts, you won't regret it!   I ordered the Irish Tacos this time because I wanted to try something new and they were delicious! Tons of corned beef paired very well with the cabbage and creamy dressing. Topped with a pickle and jalape√±os made this a well-balanced lunch with lots of complex flavors to unfold.  The beer/wine selection is also great! Would love to come back for our next team happy hour!",*Beer/wine selection is great *Brussel Sprouts are recommended *Irish Tacos were delicious, 
9,"My friend and I met here per my suggestion. I found this place on yelp, and when I saw they had lamb burgers, I had to come in and try one. When we first came in, we were greeted by the host to seated us in the bar. Not my first preference, but the place was hopping and it worked out. Our server, Kim and our other server, Melissa were great. Very attentive and pleasant. The place is really nice and play good background music at a appropriate level to listen to and still have a conversation. We started off with their signature drinks, The Kimlet and the Berry Bramble. Both were great, but I prefer the Kimlet. My friend ordered the pesto tortellini and she really liked it. It was such a nice size portion that she was able to take the rest of it home for lunch the next day.  I did order the lamb burger. It was delicious with feta cheese greens and red onion and paired it nicely with garlic  fries. We ended the night with a apple crisp with ice cream atop. It was very very good! I am so glad I decided to go here for my belated birthday dinner. Finding this gem was great. My husband and I will add it to our list of restaurants to go to for our date night. They will definitely get repeat customers here. This restaurant is the whole package. good food, good service and good ambience.","*The place is really nice and plays good background music *The restaurant is the whole package, good food, good service and good ambience", 
10,"Aurgh this place was so bad.    Sticky floors and tables, seated uncomfortably close to each other, mind deafening loud.   Mussels - watery sauce and most of the mussels were closed. We had to send it back.  California pizza- hard hard pass. The cheese was so rubbery, and it just fell off the top. The dough was a watery soggy mess.  Prime rib eye - we thought this was prime rib, but it was actually a ribeye steak. this was the best dish of the night, but the mashed potatoes and broccoli that came with it was so sad.  They need to get a real chef in here with some culinary background. You can tell it is amateur hour in the back kitchen.","*Sticky floors and tables, seated uncomfortably close to each other, mind deafening loud *Mussels had watery sauce and most of them were closed, had to send it back *California pizza was bad, rubbery cheese, watery soggy mess *Prime rib eye was the best dish of the night, but the mashed potatoes and broccoli that came with it were sad.", 
11,"Food was not good, our pizza was very soggy.  The restaurant looks nice but service was just ok. Our server didn't smile or come back to check on us. They also charge for bread and butter ( $3 for 4 tiny slices).", , 
12,"I was really craving for a margherita pizza and found that this restaurant was super close to my house so I decided to check it out. Their pizza was okay, it tasted slightly salty and cheese slid right off the slices. Not sure if I want to try other items. I'll probably drive the distance if I want margherita pizza.","*Pizza was okay, tasted slightly salty and cheese slid off the slices *Not sure if they want to try other items", 
13,When I ate here there was no wait. We got seated at the outside patio. The ambiance is really nice here. Great place to eat at on a nice day. The food was delicious and everything came out super fast. Only complaint is that the couch we had looked very dirty with stains all over it.,*No wait time *Seated at the outside patio *Ambiance is really nice *Great place to eat at on a nice day *Food was delicious and everything came out super fast *Dirty couch with stains, 
14,"They have such a lovely place, not sure why they'd choose to cram the tables in a little nook. They're ok and I think they can do better with just some tweaks. I would give it another try.  -Pizza sauce was too watery and salty. They need to cook it down more, add more garlic and onions or maybe some sugar. -The crust was good -The cheese had a chewy texture, they should use a better cheese  -Pasta was very undercooked and hard, would need to cook another 2 minutes to even reach al dente  -Pasta sauce was ok  -Lamb meatballs were ok. Heavy on oregano, not enough salt. The should serve with a sauce.","*They have such a lovely place *Pizza crust was good *Cheese had a chewy texture, they should use a better cheese *Pasta was very undercooked and hard *Lamb meatballs were ok.

15,"Came here on a weekday night because I was craving pasta and wanted to check out a local business. It was pretty empty although there seemed to be many delivery/takeout orders. Although I originally just wanted pasta, all of the other tables were ordering pizza so we went for that too.   The service is slow. Our server was nice but everyone else avoided eye contact. I am unsure why? We noticed her working on a ton of orders/tables so when she was busy, we tried calling but couldn't flag anyone else down because they kept avoiding eye contact. I didn't catch her name but there was someone who consistently ignored our niceties. There was a group that was already seated nearby us and they seemed to wait for what felt like forever for their food.   The brussels sprouts had a good sauce on them but many of them were too burnt. I originally enjoyed the crispiness but the char became distracting. They were bitter, not in a vegetable way but in a burnt food way.  The Cardinale pizza was good! We were not expecting any greens on them but I'm happy there was because they added great flavor and texture. This pizza is thin but not crispy. When you pick up your slice, it's floppy and moist. That's fine, I just folded it.   45min after ordering, we checked up on our main course, the pasta. Turns out, the kitchen forgot about our order. Our server asked if we still wanted it, and I said yes... It's our main dish...   It came out in another 20 minutes. The shrimp fettuccine did not hit the spot. It was lacking in flavor, pretty mild and creamy but definitely needed more salt, pepper, and other spices. I was considering asking for more salt but just powered through.  She eventually took it off of our bill, which I was grateful for because I was considering just leaving.  Overall, the prices are pretty high but I think you're paying for the ambiance, drinks, and fancy pizza. The drinks selection was big and I think the restaurant itself was beautiful! I just can't justify the food, prices, nor wait times.   A solid 3 because our server was sweet.","*The service is slow *The brussels sprouts had a good sauce on them but many of them were too burnt *The Cardinale pizza was good *The shrimp fettuccine did not hit the spot *I think you're paying for the ambiance, drinks, and fancy pizza", 
16,"I tried the lamb burger for lunch on a Friday. It was seasoned with herbs in a manner that hid the typical gamey aftertaste, which was pleasant. The burger was juicy, but lacked in flavor or salt. It came with a bunch of raw onions, which I felt should be saut√©ed onions or the crispy onions. Whatever arugula it came with did not taste like arugula, but was endive instead (not sure if they ran out of arugula). The bread was good- sort of like a brioche bun. The garlic fries that it came with were fresh and crunchy.  There was no customer service as the water was not refilled and the waiter did zero check ins. The restaurant wasn't super busy either. However, the interior and environment was like a modern rustic vibe. Menu items are on the pricier side. This is a pretty busy plaza, but I was able to find parking easily.","*The lamb burger was seasoned with herbs in a manner that hid the typical gamey aftertaste, which was pleasant *The burger was juicy, but lacked in flavor or salt *The bread was good - sort of like a brioche bun *The garlic fries were fresh and crunchy *The interior and environment was like a modern rustic vibe", 
17,"My first time here today and the food and service was amazing. Definitely a hidden gem.   My wife and I came here today with a couple of our friends; we have been craving for some Italian food. The Creek Eatery truly gave us what we were looking for. The atmosphere was really perfect; nice and quiet, where we were able to enjoy our meal and each other company.   Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. We are definitely looking forward to trying other things next time.   The only complaint we really had was the busser who cleaned our table. We felt like he was very rude and that he was rushing us. We had food on our plates still and it was obvious that we weren't done yet, but he insisted on grabbing the plates without asking us. He even splashed some pasta sauce on one of our friend when setting the plate back down. We just felt like he was giving us an attitude.   Would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for the busser. But I believe everyone deserve a second chance, and it's possible that he was having a bad day.",*Food and service was amazing *Atmosphere was perfect and nice and quiet *Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious *Looking forward to trying other things next time, 
18,What gives it four stars is its ambiance. Great local establishment. Came to watch the 49ers on Monday Night Football. Ate in the bar area.  Steamed mussels looked exceptional but lacked flavor. Maybe salt or maybe wine or maybe it just needed something more.  The Hoggin It pizza was super! A little in the greasy side but what do you expect with all the pork meat.  Service was good considering the barkeep was taking all the table orders in the restaurant.,*Ambiance was great *Service was good., 
19,The 2 salmon we had for delivery was so overcooked. Dry and hard like a rock. Neveragain!, , 
20, , ,"There are mixed sentiments about the food and ambiance at the restaurant. Some of the positive reviews mention superb dining options and fantastic thin crust pizza and Caesar salad. Many reviewers enjoyed the outdoor and indoor seating layouts, while others had issues with seating arrangements and noise levels. One person enjoyed the restaurant's whole package of good food, service, and ambiance, while another noted dirty couches with stains. A few reviews mentioned specific food items that were delicious, such as lamb skewers, Irish tacos, and the Cardinale pizza. However, some dishes received negative reviews due to being undercooked, burnt, or lacking in flavor. Overall, while there are some criticisms, many people were satisfied with the food and ambiance at the restaurant."
