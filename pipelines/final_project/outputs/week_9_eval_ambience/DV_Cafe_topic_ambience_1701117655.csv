0,"A number of Viet cafes recently opened in SJ to end 2022 strong!  For this location, the coffee was okay, and so were other drinks from what I can tell. Cafe has the typical interior layout; mostly tables for four but no sofas. The uniqueness is a non-Viet staff except for the owner? The atmosphere is great. Everyone is friendly and actually talks to you instead of hanging out behind the counter, lol. Many TVs are showing sports if you're not into chatting.  Easyvto find and plenty of parking. It is located in a small outdoor shopping center on the main thoroughfare Tully Rd. Add to the Viet cafes rotation, yeah.",*The atmosphere is great *Many TVs are showing sports if you're not into chatting *Easy to find and plenty of parking,
