Lo and behold, it was real f-cking meat. Absolutely disgusting, and extremely disrespectful. I ordered the vegan tikka masala, i have a diet restriction due to my health, so ive been vegan to accommodate my health. I can't eat real meat, I can't eat dairy, and these wise guys here either don't care, are discriminatory towards vegans, or are just stupid stupid and stupid. We can sue you for this. Don't be surprised if you get sued.","food=[""Just ordered the vegan tikka masala, and when I took a bite, it tasted like real meat.""",Bullet points: - Ordered vegan tikka masala - Tasted like real meat - No mention of overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction, 
1,"We saw this place have its grand opening on Facebook, and The city Mayor (Mayor Larry Klein) recommended this place on his Facebook page!! So we wanted to support a small business and we tried it!! We NEVER WRITE REVIEWS (we only have like 4 Facebook reviews and YELP reviews) but I had to share what happened with our food. Just incase somebody else had this happen to their food order. Bottom line: WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING AGAIN! We ordered one order of each of the following items: *mixed vegetable chow mein noodles *chicken chow mein noodles *Vegetable fried rice *one order of the Chicken tiki masala (The chicken tiki masala was the BEST thing that was actually good and it was a nice smooth spicy flavor too and very fresh) but the rest was ZERO STARS!! And if I can give the chicken tiki masala 3 stars I would!! but this review is for the whole entire order: So we ordered Take out, we were tired and wanted to eat at home. So we took the food home and guess what?! We were eating the noodles and we serve it and we find 4 to 5 inch piece of plastic inside the chow mein noodles!!it looked like a small piece of rubber band maybe about 4 inches or 5 inches long (small rubber band) and we live about 10 minutes from this place, we live near the AMC MOVIE THEATERS in downtown Sunnyvale, so we did not want to drive all the way back to Duane avenue and request a refund so instead we had to dispose all the chow mein noodles. We only ate the chicken tiki masala and the vegetable fried rice. And those were good fresh and delicious. But the noodles we had to throw in the garbage. For the price that we paid (around 14$ per order for the noodles) this should NEVER happen and also this place seems to be more on the Indian side of the cuisine flavors. Just an FYI this place seems to be more Indian style food (not really the Asian style you expect) and that is okay nothing wrong with Indian food, but don't expect like real chinese style food that you're used to here in America (it's not like the Panda Express style chow mein) this chow mein is more like Indian style chow mein noodles... the way they cook the chow mein noodles here at this restaurant is more heavy with the Indian style cuisine. You can tell with all of the spices and the smell that it's more Indian style type of a food place. The only GOOD thing that we ate was the order of the chicken tiki masala. But the rest of the food we threw it away - that Piece of long rubber really did leave us without an appetite!! and we will not be coming back ever again, it's as simple as that. Thank you.

2,"California MoMo Kitchen is an absolute gem located in the Fair Oaks Shopping Plaza. My husband and I enjoyed the savory veggie chow mein and delicious paneer momos!

3,"The restaurant offers a variety of lassi. The Sweet Mango Lassi is a standout, with its creamy consistency and the perfect balance of sweetness. The Salted Jeera Lassi, on the other hand, provides a refreshing and tangy contrast, making it an ideal palate cleanser. We also had some drinks. Most notablly the Masala Chai was amazing. Served piping hot in traditional clay cups, the chai is a fragrant blend of black tea, aromatic spices, and just the right amount of sweetness. The wine selection they have is extensive as well. The Serial Cab was the perfect wine to go with our meal.","food=The restaurant offers a variety of lassi.

I esepically liked the chicken momo, although my sister, Mary, thought it tasted a bit bland. The staff is so nice and the dine in experience was perfect for me.

6,"Came to this restuarant after seeing all great reviews, but was met with disappointment. I ordered online and went to pick it up at the restaurant. Not only did they not have the food ready by the estimated pick up time, I was rudely told to wait outside until the food was ready. The food itself was anything but good. The chicken masala was soo dry, there was no sauce. Everything was cold, even thought they supposedly just finished making it. The chicken momo were as small as a dime. Will definitely never come back.","food=The food itself was anything but good. The chicken masala was soo dry, there was no sauce.

7,"I ordered the food from GrubHub. Was suprised at how quickly it arrived and the food was still piping hot! Loved the chicken masala, was tender and juicy. The lassi we ordered was a bit too sweet for my liking, but was still a perfect dessert to end our meal with. Next time, will try dining in at the restaurant to get a feel for the vibes.","food=[""Loved the chicken masala, was tender and juicy.
