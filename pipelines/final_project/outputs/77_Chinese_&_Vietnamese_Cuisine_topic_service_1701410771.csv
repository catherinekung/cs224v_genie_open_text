The food - ive only had the pho (rare beef) and the Mongolian beef here but both dishes have been 10/10. I've enjoyed them so much it's been hard for me to stray away and try something new! The bowls of pho are huge and come standard with veggies + lemon to add into the soup as you'd like (and of course sriracha and hoisin). The broth is flavorful and the meat is pretty good as well! Loaded with noodles too! I've found it hard to find good pho in fidi so I'm glad I found this place awhile back. The Mongolian beef over rice is amazing, spicy, flavorful, and the perfect mix of veggies + meat. There was one time where I thought this dish was made extra spicy, I usually love spicy food but it was a lot even for me.   Service and staff are both good here. I usually get my food in 5-10min and staff is polite and may even make a joke with you! There is a restroom for customers, it's always clean and well maintained. Plenty of tables spread throughout as well. They also have bottles on hand sanitizer at each table as well which I think is great addition. Overall a great place for pho in fidi and I will definitely be back to try more of their menu","*Service and staff are both good here *I usually get my food in 5-10min and staff is polite and may even make a joke with you! *restroom for customers, always clean and well maintained.","* Good service and polite staff * Quick service, food received within 5-10 minutes * Clean and well-maintained customer restroom available", , 
1,"A good option for Asian food in FiDi area. I came here for a hot bowl of pho. The pho (rice) noodle is not exactly the original noodle but the broth and all the beef and beef balls were great and original. They are pretty busy during lunch time on weekdays for all the takeout and delivery orders so plan beforehand, either arrive there early or out an order online if you want to take out. They also do catering for companies in the area if you're wondering. Great spot for a quick lunch if you work in FiDi area.",*They are pretty busy during lunch time on weekdays for all the takeout and delivery orders so plan beforehand *Great spot for a quick lunch if you work in FiDi area.,* Busy during weekday lunch times for takeout and delivery orders * Convenient for a quick lunch if working in the FiDi area., , 
2,"Waited for my food for 30 min and it was meal pal. Everyone after me kept getting their food. Everytime I tried to ask she said she'd call my order and was brushing me off, just as I thought my order was never put in and she gave away all the meal pals to other people who arrived after me.",*Waited for my food for 30 min *Everytime I tried to ask she said she'd call my order and was brushing me off *she gave away all the meal pals to other people who arrived after me.,* Waited for 30 minutes for food * Staff member was unresponsive and gave away meal orders to other customers, , 
3,Overpriced BS! I ordered a lunch combo of rice and sweet and sour chicken and it was 18$ for majority rice and a little bit of of the actual chicken. I've never been so mad about the price of food before. The menu says 14$ I basically paid for overpriced white rice. I rather eat Panda Express.,No relevant information found., , ,

5,Food was good (not great) but the portion was rather small and to pay $17 for a small rice plate seemed not worth it. You'd think that a rice plate would be an economical lunch option but not here. Disappointed but fed.,No relevant information found., , ,

8,So I'm going to give them 4 stars because they really do have good food and the owners are nice every time we get food from them. But to be honest the last few times has been hit or miss and I don't get why when they have the same guy cooking every single day. In all honesty I don't usually eat Chinese food because I don't trust it but this place also has fresh oil free food that can be healthy for you. I just need them to stay consistent with how their food tastes.,No relevant information found., , , 
9,"These guys saved my life! And I'm not making an understatement or overstatement. I had to pull over because something went terribly wrong, I instantly got a splitting headache that cost me to pull off the freeway and then I started becoming extremely nauseous I was roaming downtown and nothing was open everything was boarded up you know because the Covid thing. Wen Was super friendly saw my condition and made sure I had amazing food and he even threw in a free drink for me. Let's just say you didn't make me eat outside. By this time I was blocks away from my car. I feel better I feel more alive after eating such amazing food!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!",*Wen Was super friendly *made sure I had amazing food *threw in a free drink for me,* Wen was super friendly * Ensured amazing food * Gave a free drink, , 
10,"This place was just so-so in my opinion. For a quick Chinese take out/Panda Express styled restaurant, they really overcharge you /: My Mom and I ordered (2) three item plates & 2 egg rolls and ended up paying $33!!! I couldn't believe it.   We ordered the salt and pepper pork chop and that in my opinion was the best thing that we ordered. The chow mein I received barely had any noodles. The green beans did not have that much flavor. My Mom ordered the chow fun and that tasted a lot better than the chow mein.   The restaurant is very small and cramped. It doesn't really have the best lighting and the door is open so it's pretty cold inside. The workers seemed nice enough, from what I could tell.","*The workers seemed nice enough, from what I could tell.",* Workers appeared to be nice, , 
11,"QUICK LUNCH AT FINANCIAL DISTRICT  Working in the Financial District in SF I only have an hour for lunch. So during that time I have to make the most of lunch. This place is fairly close to my work. Most of the time when I come here it is for the soup whether it is wor wonton or chicken, egg, and soup. I like the soup here because the broth in the soup is clean. What I like about this place is there are selections that stand out from other Chinese eateries in SF. If I decide to order three items from the steam table one of those items has to be honey pepper pork. Sometimes from the \",No relevant information found., , ,

13,"This is my go-to place for five spiced chicken. Here are my recommendations: 1. Chicken salad: yes it can make you full. Once it's served to your partner who ordered it you'll start to regret why you haven't ordered it. It's the best stir fried (not deep fried) chicken you can get, and it has noodle in it so yep it can fill you up. 2. Special pho: well you don't go wrong with pho. This is one of the dishes that's hard to screw up, just like Korean BBQ beef... 3. Vege noodle soup. It has tomato soup as the base which makes you think it's spicy at the first place, but then you'd find it's a much more friendly taste. A little downside here: you'd feel pretty full in the afternoon and that sometimes makes you feel sleepy...",No relevant information found., , , 
14,"Before the pandemic I used to work at a firm on this street, I stopped by here for lunch one day and omg I loved the seafood pho and their chili oil is amazing. I hope the workers are doing well, they were always very kind and welcoming.",*they were always very kind and welcoming.,* Staff was kind and welcoming, , 
15,"This is a pretty tiny Chinese place in the FiDi area that has a rice/noodle + 1 to 2 item plate option buffet all ready to serve, or menu items that can be ordered and prepared while you wait. Many customers seemed to choose the latter, more notably the udon and noodle soups. We went with the buffet option and each ordered a 1 item + rice plate which was served quickly and we grabbed a small table in the corner as the place was filling up quickly with people for pick up orders as well as dine-in.   For vegetarians, there's not really a lot of options available on the buffet table, but you'll find one or two items if you're not too picky. I picked the spicy tofu with a side of fried rice and while it was definitely on the spicy side, it was good, a sizeable portion, and a decent price.   If you're looking for something quick and inexpensive, and aren't a fan of the generic Chinese takeout style, this isn't a bad option if you're in the area.",*Our plates were served quickly *The place was filling up quickly with people for pick up orders as well as dine-in,* Plates were served quickly * The place was filling up quickly with people for pick-up and dine-in orders, ,

17,"I come here for the War Won Ton Soup no noodles, and the Salt and Pepper Wings. I not a big Won ton fan. But I love, love theirs. For Pot lucks in our office one of my coworkers always bring in the wings. Very good choice.  One day I tried the Pho disgusting. It reminded me of Beef Soup. Nothing like a Pho broth should be. I will never order that again.    But I will be back for the War Won Ton Soup and Wings!",No relevant information found., , , 
18,"Came here after suffering from my usual bout of indecision regarding a lunch option. Felt like something fast, filling, cheap, and maybe a tad unhealthy, so I figured Chinese food would fit that bill perfectly. And being that it was about 5 blocks away from the office, gave me a nice little jog to enjoy the fresh air before going back to work. Browsing through Yelp, I saw that 77 Chinese & Hawaii BBQ was nearby, and allowed online orders (saving me a wait in line when I arrived).   When I first arrived here, I had a bit of trouble finding this little shop as I literally walked right by it without noticing it was even there. Had to pull up my Yelp app, and use the map to realize I walked a bit too far down Battery. Upon entering, instead of getting into their assembly style line, I saw that they had a \",No relevant information found., , ,

They also appreciated the clean and well-maintained customer restroom. However, some have noted that the restaurant gets busy during weekday lunch times, which can result in longer wait times. There were also a few negative reviews about staff members being unresponsive or giving away meal orders to other customers. Despite this, there were still many positive reviews about the knowledgeable staff, especially Wen, who was described as super friendly and ensuring amazing food. Overall, it seems that the service at 77 Chinese & Vietnamese Cuisine is generally good, with friendly and efficient staff."
