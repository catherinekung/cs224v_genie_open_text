0,"Food options in the outlet mall are quite limited. After looking at all our options we settled on Green Leaf's & Bananas. The line was short and their friendly staff helped us very quickly. We ordered the Turkey Chipotle Panini has avocado, pickled onions, cilantro, pepper jack and chipotle mayo for $10.35 excluding tax. The sandwich took approximately 3 minutes to make and cook. What we received wasn't as robust as what was pictured on the menu and was consistent with another Yelp review photo however the sandwich was very flavorful and enough for my wife and I to split. The restaurant is located in the food court which does not have enough seating for the number of food kiosks and people the food court serves. We ended up eating outside due to lack of seating.",*their friendly staff helped us very quickly.,* Quick assistance from friendly staff., , 
1,Would I recommend this place!? NO! Not at all! I paid for a $5.85 plus tax cup of soup and only got $2.78 worth of soup! What a rip off! 1   for ripping me off And 1  because onion soup is my favorite.,No relevant information found., , , 
2,"Tried their chicken balsamic wrap and caesar chicken wrap in wheat wrap... As served, it was beautifully made but it was damn so cold and the wrap was rubbery like she did not even toast it or reheat a bit and straight from the wrapper.. Nasty and taste was bland... never again",No relevant information found., , , 
3,Only tried out the smoothies from here so far. It's an ok place. The mango magic seems to be the best option among the smoothies. Customer service is also good.,*Customer service is also good.,* Good customer service, , 
4,Worst tasting Pi√±a Colada Smoothie @$6.95.  No taste at all! Just colored water is all it is. Save your money. Not worth a single star but I was forced to put one in -  in order to post this warning. Let the buyer beware. Service was the pits. So save your time and money; not worth waiting for it.,*Service was the pits.,* Poor service, , 
5,"I stood in line for 10 minutes while they looked at me before asking what I wanted. I named 3 things and she said they didn't have it. I asked for something else and that also wasn't available. And she wasn't too nice either because I said never mind. I'll go somewhere else. I get it...it's a job...and you need it...but being nice and helpful goes a long way. Even if you had suggested something, I would have ordered it. No wonder there wasn't a line.",*I stood in line for 10 minutes while they looked at me before asking what I wanted. *And she wasn't too nice either *being nice and helpful goes a long way.,* Long wait in line with no acknowledgement * Unfriendly staff member, , 
6,"Since Green Leaf's Beyond Great Salads was the only stall in the Livermore Outlet food court that served healthy dining options, I decided to try it out. There was a long queue, however, and it moved quite slowly. The other folks in my party got in line elsewhere after me, and I was still the last one to the table.  The most prominent item on the menu is the Pick & Mix Salad, where you select an option of greens, 4 toppings, and a dressing. You also have a choice of either a small or regular sized bowl. Other items they sell include paninis, wraps, and specialty sandwiches.  // Pick & Mix Salad - 3 stars Regular size. Spinach. Red pepper pesto dressing. Grilled chicken, broccoli, mandarin orange, and artichoke. This meal was actually decent, exceeding my low expectations. Although the broccoli wasn't great, the orange slices and artichokes were very fresh. I was also pleasantly surprised with how tender the chicken was. Not a bad deal considering the large portion size!  Overall, I would recommend giving this place a shot. There isn't a better option in the area if you're looking to fuel yourself with healthy calories before (or after) frolicking around Livermore. Happy shopping!","*There was a long queue, however, and it moved quite slowly. *Although the service is not mentioned directly, the mention of the long queue could be indicative of slow service.",* Long queue * Slow service implied due to long queue, ,

8,"Green Leaf's is conveniently located in the food court of the outlet mall, making it an easy stop for a relatively healthy meal in between hours of shopping. And it IS the only healthyish option available in the food court, which is a little unfortunate, especially after walking through the block of sports brand stores.   I ordered the Turkey Chipotle Panini, and a side salad. The side salad is a small bowl of lettuce, and you can choose two of the available salad toppings as well as one of their dressings. I chose jalapenos, carrots, and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The jalapenos were maybe not my best decision, but it was nice to add them to my panini. The panini itself was good enough. I wish there was more avocado, but other than that, it was a decent sandwich.   It was a little weird because the woman who rang me up handed me the side salad, and said that I could sit down to wait for the panini, and then didn't call a number or indicate in any way that my panini was done, so it was a little cold by the time I went up to ask about it. It's possible that I was supposed to pick it up all along, but that wasn't communicated very well.   Anyways, I'll probably opt to snack at Auntie Anne's, and wait for a real meal next time. Not super impressed.","*It was a little weird because the woman who rang me up handed me the side salad, and said that I could sit down to wait for the panini, and then didn't call a number or indicate in any way that my panini was done, so it was a little cold by the time I went up to ask about it. *that wasn't communicated very well.",* Poor communication from staff * Customer had to wait for panini without indication of when it was ready * Panini was cold when received, , 
9,"C'mon, guys! Let's at least try to do things right.   I was at Greenleafs recently and ordered their Turkey BLTA wrap with basil aoli on a whole wheat tortilla. It was poorly executed. Avocado was on one half of the wrap and the basil aoli was on the other. Furthermore, the wrap was pre-made. Though I do prefer freshly made sandwiches/wraps. I don't really mind if they were made in advance. That is unless avocado is involved. By the time I ordered, the avocado had already turned brown.   These are minor mistakes that can be easily corrected, but even then, the wrap would only be 3 stars at best.",No relevant information found., , ,

14,"Meehh !! I was really hungry after a long day of retail therapy and spotted this place in the outlet food court. I ordered a Chicken Panini which was the most sad Panini I ever had. No seasoning on the chicken, soggy bread and lined with dead lettuce leaves. This place does let you make your own sandwich or salad. Overall, I won't go to this place again. I would prefer food trucks standing inside the outlets premises over this place.",No relevant information found., , , 
15,"Well, I was certainly satisfied for the most.  **This review is specifically for Greenleafs**  After doing some shopping and working up a bit of an appetite, I realized I should probably grab something to eat.

19,"THIS PLACE WAS BEYOND NOT WORTH THE MONEY. The food is actually disgusting , the area they make it in is filthy. The people working there were rude and inconsiderate . It was actually insane . We waited for a salad and a sandwich for 30 minutes ... and we were the only customers at that moment ! We saw a bigger set lady smell the sauce that she was putting on my girlfriends sandwich . I honestly do not understand why it took so long . They had 4 people working at the same time . I'm disgusted . The salad I bought was so disgusting as well . The eggs tasted expired , the lady put way too much sauce and didn't ask if I wanted it on the side ! We spend over 17$ here for a gross sandwich and salad . We asked if we could get a refund .

Some customers had positive experiences, stating that the staff was quick to assist and provided good customer service.

In one instance, a customer had to wait for a panini without any indication of when it was ready, and when it was finally received, it was cold. Additionally, there were complaints about a staff member using the same blender for multiple smoothies without cleaning it, and having an attitude. Overall, the sentiment towards the service at Green Leaf's & Bananas is mixed, with some customers having positive experiences and others having negative ones."
