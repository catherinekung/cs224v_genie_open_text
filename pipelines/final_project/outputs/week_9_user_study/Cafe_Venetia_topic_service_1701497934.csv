0,"I'm torn about giving this place a high review.  Why?  Because I don't want it too busy that we will NOT be able to find a place to sit and chat with friends and catch-up.   I like their setup.  Small tables for your drinks and pastries or desserts but not convenient enough for laptop folks to camp there with their one drinks hugging the tables for hours.  I am VERY THANKFUL for this design.  BRAVO!!! It been downtown for a long time and it is one of the only place open late.  So please keep your closing LATER PLEASE!!! Great drinks!  We have had coffees and teas.  They have descent selection.  Also descent selections of deserts and pastries.    If you want better coffees and teas, please go somewhere else.  If you want better pastries and desserts, again, please go somewhere else.  If you are planning to work on your laptop, please stay home.   This place is great for meeting friends that is NOT a loud bar where you have to drink alcohol, yell and scream your conversation type of place.  This is a great place to discuss your next charity event, next business idea, next family event, next wedding, how's your health, how's your family, and I haven't seen you in a long time, let's catch up kind of place.   Service is efficient.  People who works there I think do their best.  And they do a job well done.  Sound level is perfect for conversation.   Not too quiet not too loud.  We were able to heard each others stories and comments very well while keeping engage with each other and not get distracted by others in the place.   We will continue to frequent this place.  But please try to STAY OPEN LATER especially for Friday-Saturday nights.  We have nothing else in Palo Alto.   Thank you for providing this service to our community.

1,"Cute space and the default tips are not ridiculous on the payment system are the only real positives. Oh and location and sunny seating area  The espresso was poorly pulled and extremely bad. Bitter, no crema and with no complexity of flavor. The Italians invented modern espresso and Californians took it to new highs of sweetness. What this cafe serves is a disaster compared to how good espresso can be",No relevant information found., , , 
2,Their milk based hot chocolate was sheer bliss! Divine!  It's not your regular hot chocolate.  Thick. Creamy. So chocolatey. Almost a pudding-like consistency that is still pourable. You won't regret getting it!  We got it with a slice of chocolate chip cake and Tiramisu. Everything was awesome.  Tiramisu was velvety and rich. That mascarpone cheese with espresso flavor was amazing.  Cute cafe. Great baristas.  Highly recommended!,*Cute cafe *Great baristas *Highly recommended!,* Cute cafe * Great baristas * Highly recommended!, , 
3,"We were treated badly by one of the servers and he was complaining while taking our order, while another server was more patient and tried to help preparing the order in a nice manner. The order was only a cappuccino and cardamom hot chocolate and I definitely had better ones than this cafe, the hot chocolate is so dense you would rather eat it with spoon not drink it although the flavor is decent but the texture is bad. The only positive thing besides that one nice server is that the cafe opens late in a nice area to take a coffee and walk.",*We were treated badly by one of the servers *another server was more patient and tried to help *besides that one nice server,* Poor treatment by one server * Another server was patient and helpful * One server provided good service, ,

5,"I just randomly found this place on a Friday evening after stopping by a bookstore and wanted to find a quant location where I could enjoy the beautiful weather and read. I'm not a big coffee drinker so I just ordered a random drink which ended up being their Latte Macchiato, I was hoping it wouldn't be too strong while tasting a little refreshing and it was spot on. I also asked the employee what he recommended to snack on during my reading and he recommended a slice of cake, which I do not remember the name but it had slices of fruit on top and on the inside, very delicious and a great recommendation.  After spending a couple of hours here, so many people stopped by this coffee shop and really created a calming atmosphere that I feel so many places try to create but fail to.   Surprisingly this place gets really crowded around 8-9 pm on a Friday and gave off lively energy being one of the only coffee shops open this late. Someone was even playing the accordion! Definitely will come back to try more of their pastries.",*asked the employee what he recommended to snack on during my reading *he recommended a slice of cake *so many people stopped by this coffee shop and really created a calming atmosphere *Someone was even playing the accordion!,* Asked employee for snack recommendation while reading * Employee recommended a slice of cake * Calming atmosphere with many visitors * Live accordion performance, , 
6,"I can't believe I haven't been to this place yet. We entered the cafe at the right time, the moment we ordered I saw a huge line behind us.  We had hot chocolate paired with Panettone cake. The hot chocolate was perfect. It was velvety smooth, creamy and right proportion of chocolate. And the cake was so light and tasty that it melted in my mouth leaving fruity tangy flavors behind. The cafe had a cute setup with small colorful tables inside and outside. Enjoying cold winter evening inside this warm cozy cafe with hot chocolate and cake was such a delight!",No relevant information found., , , 
7,"We were out with a group of friends and wanted something to satisfy our sweet tooth, this spot hit the mark! I didn't know what to expect as I haven't had high end hot cocoa before but all of our drinks were made well and we ended up happy with our choices.  The aesthetics of the shop are quite nice and I could see it being a good place to study, there were a couple of people doing work on their laptops during our visit.  I would say my only disappointment was the portion size was slightly smaller than I expected, but the flavors were quite rich so I believe they were sized well in that regard.  I would like to return to try other flavors!",No relevant information found., , , 
8,Inconsistent Hot chocolate thickness. Pricy for it's quality. Hard to swallow Rude barrista staff. Although the Cashier is nice. I will never recommend this place or never will i come back.,*Hard to swallow *Rude barrista staff.,* Difficult to swallow * Rude barista staff, , 
9,My date took me here and we sat outside! Would recommend if you're checking it out for that reason!  Great place to people watch and enjoy your beverage and pastry. It's feel very Italy like sitting outdoor! Check it out!,No relevant information found., , , 
10,"Stumbled across this cute cafe on a Saturday night,  They had lots of business at 9:40pm and it was a great place to sit down and chat. I appreciate their late closing time because it's hard to find nice places to hangout at later in the evening. Cafe Venetia had a very Italian feel with their small outdoor tables and decorations.  Strawberry Panna Cotta: my first time trying panna cotta and it was fantastic! I loved the consistency of the gelatin cream and the strawberry spread ontop tasted fresh  Cream Puff: very stale and the filling inside wasn't anything special, it was less sweet than a typical cream puff  These two desserts totaled to $16...   which is pretty outrageous for how light/small they were. If I were to come back again I'd go for something with better bang for my buck, I felt pretty ripped off.",No relevant information found., , ,

13,"It was my first time at this cafe meeting a friend. We stood in line to get our order; cafe latte to stay (great flavor and nice touch of design) and I grabbed a piece of their classic cheesecake. Made with ricotta and not so sweet which I loved. I also lucked out getting a tiny shot worth of their chocolate mouse. Perfect pairing.  My friend had been to this place before but it had possibly changed ownership and her favorite teas were no longer available. Her latte was still wonderful.  Service was fast after ordering and we grabbed a little table with chairs inside since it was a bit chilly that day. Not many other places to sit inside as most tables and chairs were set out.  However, we were still cold since all the windows were open and had to keep our coats and scarfs on.  Very busy and popular. But we were able to sit and chat for a while.","*Service was fast after ordering *Very busy and popular *However, we were still cold since all the windows were open and had to keep our coats and scarfs on.",* Fast service after ordering * Very busy and popular establishment * Open windows made it uncomfortably cold, , 
14,"We had a cafe marchiano, which was okay, nothing special, A drinking chocolate with cinnamon, which isn't really drinkable, just a thick blob of cocoa with something,  And a pistachio choux pastry, which was dry, and the filling wasn't great either. Oh, and they don't give you lids for your to go cups.  The outdoor sitting is a little weird too- if you're expected to clean up after yourself, there isn't a clear area to put plates away. We (and others too) were cleaning other peoples table to sit down, and the workers won't come clear anything.","*They don't give you lids for your to go cups *If you're expected to clean up after yourself, there isn't a clear area to put plates away *We (and others too) were cleaning other peoples table to sit down, and the workers won't come clear anything","* No lids provided for to-go cups * No clear area designated for placing plates away * Customers had to clean tables themselves to sit down, and workers did not clear tables.", , 
15,"This is the place to come if you like chocolate. They have chocolate mousse, chocolate tartes, and 3-4 different types of drinking chocolates! I always love these because they are thick and rich. It tastes and feels luxurious. The café reminds me a lot of Europe, it's decorated with vibrant colors, and has nicely prepared and presented coffee drinks.   Whenever I'm in Palo Alto I like stopping by here. I like strolling around University Avenue, there are so many cute stores here.",No relevant information found., , , 
16,"Cute place! Though it looks tight, there's tons of seating (and outlets). I got my drink pretty quickly despite there being a line. I got the cappuccino Viennese. It's my first time drinking. I thought it was pretty good. Next time I'll get a dessert as well!",*I got my drink pretty quickly despite there being a line.,* Drink was served quickly despite there being a line, , 
17,"This has been my favorite coffee+ chocolate place for years in Palo Alto.  All of their coffee is hand made on the spot. Super authentic. Love that!  Their specialty really is their chocolates. Drinking chocolate, tarts, mousse, many different exotic varieties.  Everything comes out sooooo good. Once in a while we need to indulge ourselves. This is the place for that.  Really enjoy the cozy  and relaxing vibes.",No relevant information found., , , 
18,"Pretentious and rude staff. This tall skinny 18 year old male Italian barista,... just cuz you have an accent doesn't mean you can't accept a customer's special request for their beverage. Also, Learn to pull a shot.

20, , , , ,"There are mixed reviews regarding the service at Cafe Venetia. Some customers praised the efficient and hardworking staff, as well as the cute cafe and great baristas. Others have mentioned poor treatment by one server, but another server was patient and helpful while one provided good service. In contrast, some customers have described the staff as pretentious and rude, unable to accommodate special requests for beverages, and being paid a low wage. Despite these reviews, some customers enjoyed the calming atmosphere, live accordion performance, and fast service after ordering. However, there were complaints about the open windows making it uncomfortably cold, no lids being provided for to-go cups, and no clear area designated for placing plates away. Customers had to clean tables themselves to sit down, and workers did not clear tables. Overall, the reviews were mixed, with both positive and negative experiences with the service at Cafe Venetia."
