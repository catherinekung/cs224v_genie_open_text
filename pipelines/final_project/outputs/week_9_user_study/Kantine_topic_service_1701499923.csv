"*food takes awhile to come out when they're busy 
*One area of improvement was how to flow customers against employees bringing out food 
*awkward fashion for both parties"," There are mixed sentiments regarding the service at Kantine. Some reviews have praised the service, describing it as amazing, with friendly staff and a very casual vibe. On the other hand, there were some complaints about the service, such as slow food delivery during busy periods, long wait times, and awkward customer-employee interactions. Some also experienced delays and a ruined mood due to the wait times. However, the ordering process is relatively simple and there are indoor and outdoor seating options available. It is recommended for casual breakfast/brunch, and although the service is similar to a cafe/food court, Kantine still offers table service. On crowded Saturdays, it can get chaotic and one suggestion was to have one person scout for seats while the other orders. Overall, there are some mixed sentiments about the service, but it seems that the staff is friendly."
