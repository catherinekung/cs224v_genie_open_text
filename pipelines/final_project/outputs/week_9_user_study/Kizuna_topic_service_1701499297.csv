Relevant Content,Summary
"*Didn't really interact with the staff, but they were nice."," There are a variety of service experiences at Kizuna. The restaurant has a self-service dining experience where customers order and pay through a QR code and are expected to clean up after themselves. Some reviewers have expressed that they were dissatisfied with the mandatory 15% minimum tip and having to box their own to-go containers. However, most people appreciated the quick service and hot food. Seating can be limited and it can get busy at times, but the staff are generally friendly and efficient. There are multiple options for ordering such as QR codes on tables, ordering at the front counter, or ordering at the cashier. Some have noted a short wait time for orders and that the food was served quickly. However, there were a few complaints about wait times, including waiting almost 15 minutes to get a table. Overall, the service seems to be pleasant and efficient with some minor issues that might depend on the individual's preference."
