0,"The fan tuan (rice burrito) was so yummy! We got: * white rice burrito with pork belly  * purple rice burrito - original   Both fan tuans were flavorful and packed with fillings. I preferred the purple rice burrito (fillings include boiled egg, youtiao, tofu, pork floss and pickled vegetatables) while my partner liked the pork belly better (same as original but pork belly instead of egg). I thought the pork belly was too fatty, but it tasted good regardless.  The total came out to be $14.50 (we paid by cash). My partner and I were overwhelmed with the traditional Mandarin menu but we were able to secure the goods. The lady speaks English and the prepackaged hot foods also have English labels.   The location is very lowkey and there was no space to eat there. Fan tuan can be messy so be careful as you enjoy them! Make sure to go early for more options. They were scarce on burritos when we came around 11am Saturday. I'll be back!!",Bullet points: - Fan tuans (rice burritos) were flavorful and packed with fillings. - Purple rice burrito was preferred by the user. - Partner liked the pork belly burrito better. - Pork belly burrito was fatty but tasted good regardless., 
1,"The hole in a wall place has superb authentic Taiwanese food! Yes, they don't have indoor or outdoor seating, but the food is so good that it's worth the effort to takeout and eat at home or at the park when the weather is great.   A tip now that I've been there once, GO EARLY or order ahead. They sell out quickly, especially the extra good stuff.   We got:  1) Hainan chicken rice - the chicken is so juicy and tender, and goes well with the flavored chicken rice with condiments. This is GOOD chicken rice.   2) Red pork chop rice - if you know, you know. This is delicious and reminds me of the red pork chop in Taiwan!   3) Rice burrito (rice on the outside with assorted vegetables, braised egg, and Chinese doughnut) - oh so so good and it hits the spot as I was reminded of how much I miss this when I first had it in Taiwan. Haven't found anywhere else that makes these and especially when it is made so delicious!   We will be back and yes, will be there early to get the other items that we sadly couldn't get our hands on.","Bullet points: - Juicy and tender Hainan chicken rice with flavorful condiments - Delicious red pork chop rice that reminds of Taiwan - Tasty rice burrito with assorted vegetables, braised egg, and Chinese doughnut on the outside - Unique dishes that are not commonly found elsewhere and are made deliciously", 
2,"Wow what a wonderful gem. You would never know that in this sea of office buildings there is a kitchen selling wonderful Taiwanese food, with the best Fan Tuan in the East bay. The service is as you would expect and the ambiance is no frills...but you come here for the food. Now, ordering from this place is NOT easy, but if you are interested in tasty Fan Tuan (their specialty) then read on. Everything is in Chinese, including the menus, but their most popular items are:   Original Fan Tuan (no egg)  Purple Rice Fan Tuan (has braised egg in it)  Hainan Chicken Bento  Red Pork Cutlet Bento  Fried Pork Chop Bento Garlic Beef Shank Bento  Most things are preorder only, and you have to do it 1-3 days in advance via the process below. They DO NOT pick up their phones reliably, nor do same day orders.   Guide to get your wonderful Fan Tuan:  1. Go to Facebook and type in MITK (see the image below) and request to join their Facebook group.  2. Once you are accepted, find the most recent post. Alternatively, you can DM her like I did to begin your order.  3. You can respond directly to the most recent post with your order details. Advise your pick up date and order and be specific. Maxine, the owner will respond with a number that you will tell the cashier when you go for pick up.  4. Orders are ready for you when they open, around ~12. When you arrive, look for the blue tent (see pictures below). The address does not take you directly to the shop but just drive around the plaza looking for the tent/ shop signage.  5. Stand in line and when it's your turn, pay with cash (you get a discount) or card.   They may or may not have extra items for sale that day. Preorder to avoid disappointment. Good luck!","Bullet points: - Kitchen selling wonderful Taiwanese food - Best Fan Tuan in the East Bay - Popular menu items include Original Fan Tuan, Purple Rice Fan Tuan, Hainan Chicken Bento, Red Pork Cutlet Bento, Fried Pork Chop Bento, Garlic Beef Shank Bento - Menus are in Chinese - Extra items may or may not be available for sale - Preorder to avoid disappointment", 
3,"I found out about this Taiwanese takeout food place from my sister-in-law. It's in an area with a bunch of warehouses and we drove slowly to find their storefront/entrance. They have parking stalls right in front of their entrance.   My sister-in-law did a pre-ordered and we got a few things to share. My favorites were the fan tuan and the sheng jian bao. The fan tuan was still warm and the filling in the center had ground pork, preserved vegetables, and Chinese donut crispies. The sheng jian bao was made fresh, it was hot, so we let it cool down before eating it. The bao was super juicy so be careful on the first bite. It was filled with pork and the outside of the bao was cooked perfectly.  The inside the of store is also stocked with Taiwanese snacks, instant noodles, and toys. The lady in the shop was friendly and she explained what some of the items were to me in English since I don't speak Mandarin. We bought some chilled pudding and a few varieties of instant noodles to try since we don't get those products in Hawaii. I highly recommend checking out this place for the delicious Taiwanese foods/snacks.","Bullet points: - Favorites were fan tuan and sheng jian bao - Fan tuan had ground pork, preserved vegetables, and Chinese donut crispies in the center - Sheng jian bao was made fresh and hot, had to cool down before eating - Bao was super juicy, be careful on first bite - Bao filled with pork and cooked perfectly on the outside", 
4,"Follow the preorder instructions per the 12/22 review. I drove by the location since there wasn't a tent (I didn't get there until after 1pm). There are two driveways to the U-shaped complex. The little shop is #18 and along the east side.   Since I don't read Chinese, I used the Facebook translation. Some of it didn't make sense so I used Google Translate (which is what the son uses to create the online menus, I found out).   I still wasn't quite clear on how it worked for specials, and put in a preorder later than intended (afternoon before). It was acknowledged but with the busy morning, she forgot (I didn't follow up on not getting a pickup number, so partly on me). They made it fresh for me since I was willing to wait. That's ok, now I know.  I ordered Os (original fan tuan/rice roll/rice ball, spicy), an Op (with pork, which was listed in the other locations special menu for that day), and since there was some spicy numb chicken left so I got one of those too. Everything was good. The Os was just spicy enough for me; I had saved that one for an on-the-road trip the next day so the rice was a little hard by then and I didn't have a way to heat it up, but it was still good. The chicken was tastier than it looks. I learned from her that she doesn't put a lot of the numbing spice in (she doesn't like that she can't taste anything else if there's too much), and I actually couldn't detect it. It wasn't that spicy (the spice happened to be in the last part of the half I'd saved for the next day's dinner), but it was really tasty all the same, and the chicken was very tender. I wish I'd known about this place sooner.","Bullet points: - Overall good food quality. - The Os had the right amount of spice. - Chicken was tastier than it looks. - Chicken was tender and tasty, but not too spicy.", 
5,"This place is hidden in the middle of nowhere. It's next to some warehouses with parking available. Even though the location of the store doesn't seem like much, there was a line of people waiting outside. There is a way to reserve your order on their Facebook group online cuz their more popular items like the fan tuan (rice balls) get sold out later in the day.   We pre-ordered some fan tuan, oyster misua noodles, and stinky tofu. There were also premade dishes in the store that you can choose from. We got the Hainan chicken rice and sticky rice from there. There was a fridge on the side of the store that has additional items. The inside of the store isn't big so most people wait outside for their turn. Their menus are also mostly in Chinese which isn't a deal breaker if you can speak Chinese or if you want something that is premade in the store.   We took our items to go since there is nowhere to eat there. They were nice enough to leave the lid of the stinky tofu open so it doesn't get soggy. It was definitely very pungent but we all like the smell of it. We haven't found a lot of places with good crispy stinky tofu outside of Taiwan. Since the lid was left open, the tofu did get a bit cold by the time we arrived home, but definitely reminds us of Taiwan! The fan tuans all have a lot of filling and not too much rice. Very good ratio and tasty. The other items were very solid choices and great if you're craving those particular items. This is a great place for authentic Taiwanese street food!",Bullet points: - Fan tuans have a lot of filling and not too much rice - Good ratio and tasty - Other items are solid choices - Great if craving specific items, 
6,"Heard about this place from a friend and had to try. I tried calling in my order for immediate pick up on Thursday at 12pm but everything was already sold out. I think they mostly do preorders. I preordered 2 original fantuan, 2 purple rice fantuan, 2 pork chop bento and their daily special, for Friday, was the boneless Hainanese chicken rice. The location is in an industrial park. Pickup the next day was simple and they take cash and some epayments. Food was really delicious but don't expect it to be piping hot. May need to reheat or just eat warm/room temp since it's freshly made earlier each day. We'll be back. Kids loved all the options we ordered.",Bullet points: - Food is delicious. - Don't expect it to be piping hot. - May need to reheat or eat warm/room temp. - Freshly made earlier each day.,

9,"It's basically a shop/warehouse where you go pick up Taiwanese food. It's in a  warehouse district. There see no shop around.  When I was there everyone have their masks on, staff, customers, everyone. The \", , 
10, , ,"Maxine Kitchen seems to have an impressive variety of dishes, with many reviewers praising their unique menu items. A standout dish among reviewers is the fan tuan, which is a flavorful rice burrito with fillings like ground pork, preserved vegetables, and Chinese donut crispies in the center. The fan tuans seem to have a good filling-to-rice ratio and are tasty according to multiple reviewers. Some prefer the purple rice fan tuan, while others prefer the pork belly burrito, despite it being fatty. The sheng jian bao, a pan-fried pork bun, is another favorite among reviewers, with many describing it as juicy and cooked perfectly. The Hainan chicken rice and red pork chop rice are also highly recommended dishes, with reviewers describing the chicken as tender and tasty and the pork chop as flavorful and reminiscent of Taiwan. Other bento box options, like the garlic beef shank and fried pork chop, are also mentioned as popular menu items. Overall, reviewers seem to agree that Maxine Kitchen offers delicious food, with some even going so far as to call it the best Taiwanese food in the East Bay."
