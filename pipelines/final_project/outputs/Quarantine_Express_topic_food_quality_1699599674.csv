I'll be honest that I wasn't a fan of the noodles inside the quesadilla but I will say that it tasted very much like pho w/ the addition of the tortilla.    The BBH burrito blew my mind on the other hand.  This was spicy and the broth that came w/ it acted like a dipping sauce but it didn't need it.  The burrito wasn't dry - tasted bomb on its own.  I will come back to order 5 of these.    BTW - word has it that they have tamales now!  Check this place out on IG and try it for yourself.  Now more than ever it's important to not only eat well, be happy, and support local businesses!","Bullet points: - Noodles inside the quesadilla were not preferred by the user. - Quesadilla tasted like pho with the addition of the tortilla. - BBH burrito was highly appreciated by the user. - Burrito was spicy and not dry, and tasted great even without the dipping sauce.",
