[web] I will check some things you said.

(1) You said: Your nose switches back and forth between nostrils. When you sleep, you switch about every 45 minutes.
This is to prevent a buildup of mucus. It’s called the nasal cycle.
I checked: How often do your nostrils switch?
I found this article: Although we don’t usually notice it, during the nasal cycle one nostril becomes congested and thus
contributes less to airflow, while the other becomes decongested. On average, the congestion pattern switches about
every 2 hours, according to a small 2016 study published in the journal PLOS One.
Your nose’s switching time is about every 2 hours, not 45 minutes.
This disagrees with what you said.

(2) You said: The Little House books were written by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The books were published by HarperCollins.
I checked: Who published the Little House books?
I found this article: These are the books that started it all -- the stories that captured the hearts and imaginations
of children and young adults worldwide. Written by Laura Ingalls Wilder and published by HarperCollins, these beloved
books remain a favorite to this day.
The Little House books were published by HarperCollins.
This agrees with what you said.

(3) You said: The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in the basement of Jordan Hall, Stanford’s psychology
building.
I checked: Where was Stanford Prison Experiment conducted?
I found this article: Carried out August 15-21, 1971 in the basement of Jordan Hall, the Stanford Prison Experiment set
out to examine the psychological effects of authority and powerlessness in a prison environment.
The Stanford Prison Experiment was conducted in Jordan Hall.
This agrees with what you said.

(4) You said: Social work is a profession that is based in the philosophical tradition of humanism. It is an
intellectual discipline that has its roots in the 1800s.
I checked: When did social work have its roots?
I found this article: The Emergence and Growth of the Social work Profession<br><br> Social work’s roots were planted in
the 1880s, when charity organization societies (COS) were created to organize municipal voluntary relief associations
and settlement houses were established.
Social work has its roots in the 1880s, not 1800s.
This disagrees with what you said.

(4) You said: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm for converting the adjacency matrix of a graph into its
adjacency list. It is named after Vaclav Havel and Samih Hakimi.
I checked: What is the Havel-Hakimi algorithm?
I found this article: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm constructs a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree
sequence exists, or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. This construction is based on a recursive algorithm.
The algorithm was published by Havel (1955), and later by Hakimi (1962).
Havel-Hakimi algorithm is for constructing a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree sequence exists, or
proving that one cannot find a positive answer, not converting the adjacency matrix of a graph into its adjacency list.
This disagrees with what you said.

(5) You said: "Time of My Life" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bill Medley from the soundtrack of the 1987 film
Dirty Dancing. The song was produced by Michael Lloyd.
I checked: Who was the producer of "(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life"?

inappropriately towards a Labour Party activist, Ava Etemadzadeh.
I checked: Why was Kelvin Hopins suspeneded from the Labor Party?
I found this article: A former Labour MP has left the party before an inquiry into sexual harassment allegations against
him was able to be concluded, the party has confirmed. Kelvin Hopkins was accused in 2017 of inappropriate physical
contact and was suspended by the Labour party pending an investigation.This agrees with what you said.
Kelvin Hopins was suspended because he had allegedly sexually harassed and behaved inappropriately towards a Labour
Party activist, Ava Etemadzadeh.

(7) You said: In the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British side was led by General Thomas Smith.
I checked: Who led the British side in the battle of Lexington and Concord?
