Title: HIP 65426 b
Article: It is around 92 AU from its parent star, with a possible dusty atmosphere. It was discovered as part of the SHINE program, which aimed to find planetary systems around 600 new stars. In August 2022, this planet and its host star were included among 20 systems to be named by the third NameExoWorlds project. In September 2022, it became the first exoplanet directly observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Planetary atmosphere. The spectrum taken in 2020 has indicated that HIP 65426 b is carbon-poor and oxygen-rich compared to Solar System gas giants. James Webb Space Telescope observation. In August 2022, a pre-print of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations was published.

Title: UDFy-38135539
Article: They will therefore be increasingly difficult to find, since they would be very faint with fewer observable stars. Trenti says that new \"most distant\" record holders will soon be announced, but only incremental distance gains will be realized until NASA's James Webb Space Telescope becomes operational, which occurred in 2022. The James Webb Space Telescope has detected galaxies more than 13.4 billion light years away, less than 300 million years after the Big Bang. Bremer states that it, and eventually the European Extremely Large Telescope, which will have a mirror five times the diameter of Yepun's, and is tentatively scheduled for first light in 2024, will enable more detailed study of galaxies at such great distances.

Title: Biosignature
Article: Despite this, it is a rapidly growing field of research due to the prospects of the next generation of telescopes. The James Webb Space Telescope, which launched in December 2021, will be a promising next step in the search for biosignatures. Although its wavelength range and resolution will not be compatible with some of the more important atmospheric biosignature gas bands like oxygen, it will still be able to detect some evidence for oxygen false positive mechanisms. The new generation of ground-based 30-meter class telescopes (Thirty Meter Telescope and Extremely Large Telescope) will have the ability to take high-resolution spectra of exoplanet atmospheres at a variety of wavelengths.
