[web] I will check some things you said.

(1) Context: They said: Do you know about nose switches?
You said: Your nose switches back and forth between nostrils. When you sleep, you switch about every 45 minutes. This is to prevent a buildup of mucus. It’s called the nasal cycle.
I checked: Your nostrils switch about every 45 minutes when you sleep.
I found this article: Although we don’t usually notice it, during the nasal cycle one nostril becomes congested and thus contributes less to airflow, while the other becomes decongested. On average, the congestion pattern switches about every 2 hours, according to a small 2016 study published in the journal PLOS One.
Your nose’s switching time is about every 2 hours, not 45 minutes.
This disagrees with what you said.

(2) Context: They said: Can you tell me more about the Little House books, like the author and the publisher?
You said: The Little House books were written by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The books were published by HarperCollins.
I checked: The Little House books were published by HarperCollins.
I found this article: These are the books that started it all -- the stories that captured the hearts and imaginations of children and young adults worldwide. Written by Laura Ingalls Wilder and published by HarperCollins, these beloved books remain a favorite to this day.

I checked: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm for converting the adjacency matrix of a graph into its adjacency list.
I found this article: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm constructs a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree sequence exists, or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. This construction is based on a recursive algorithm. The algorithm was published by Havel (1955), and later by Hakimi (1962).
Havel-Hakimi algorithm is for constructing a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree sequence exists, or proving that one cannot find a positive answer, not converting the adjacency matrix of a graph into its adjacency list.
