1,"I had time to kill and wasnt all that hungry but decided to stop by and have a snack. I only had the Lil'Peckers (chicken strips), funny name btw. Its my second time here but this time by myself so I got to talk Shehraaz for a bit as he took my order. Great guy and with great customer service. I walked in several minutes before 2pm on a Friday and sure enough two parties between 4 and 6 people came in to order and they sat outside. I sat inside but its nice to see outdoor seating since Im from SF. As someone who's worked in a very similar restaurant, it brought back some good memories.","1.

3,"This place is hands down a 5 star as everything I have had food wise is amazing. From the Nashville Benedict to the melts they have. It's amazing and flavorful. Been here twice and will go back some more to try other things.   BUT the last time I was here. The waitress was a being animated a lot with her personality. Which isn't a bad thing but also not a good thing at certain points. When she was taking my order, I said the Nashville melt, and the breakfast at the time had a Nashville Benedict and the waitress thought I meant that and then when I corrected myself and said the firebird she was dancing along with the music and completely didn't hear me and when she was done taking my dads order I mentioned once again I wanted the firebird. She was oh and that too! When I tried to say no I only want firebird she already walked away. When she eventually brought out all the food and my dad was confused why there was another order and I him just to leave it and I explained to him outside that she was to busy being animated when I corrected myself and she didn't even hear me.   Other than that experience, place is really good and I suggest to give it a try",1. [food]=everything I have had food wise is amazing. From the Nashville Benedict to the melts they have.

4,"Hmm, definitely very eclectic vibe. Decor and menu go with the vibe.  I was actually really excited to try this place but was disappointed... maybe the kitchen was having an off day?  Ordered:  1) Mac and Cheese: 3/5 large portion and the taste was OK. Better than the burger 2) Angus Burger: 2/5 It was dry and nothing exciting. For the price you would think it would come with fries, but it was just the burger.  Eventually one day, I will give it a try again. Hopefully, they were having an off day. Or maybe I didn't order the right items.","1. [Food]=Mac and Cheese: 3/5 large portion and the taste was OK. Better than the burger 2. [Food]=Angus Burger: 2/5 It was dry and nothing exciting.

5,"Stopped in on a Friday evening & chose to sit inside. It wasn't too busy. service was ok (waitress could've been friendlier)  Ordered the truffle Mac & cheese, patty melt & beef poutine (steak fries - finally!) All were good. The mermaid Tea was great.  Picked up a few cookies on the way out (3 for $10) - they were great.  We're likely to go back to sample other menu items.","1.

6,"There's nothing funny about this place. It's incredible how much they've improved. I was at their original place years ago when they had a tiny space in the corner of a divey bar. Now THAT was weird. It was awkward to bring a 3-year-old with drunks hanging out at the bar. However, the food was delicious!!!  But now... WOW! This new location is so much better! Bigger, cleaner, and more family-friendly!!  The four of us had dinner here on a Tuesday night. The food is still excellent!   It took a lot of thinking to choose from their menu. Everything looked so good! But I finally decided on the Truffle Shuffle. The burger was perfectly cooked on a  brioche bun. The combination of truffle, sauce, and gooey swiss cheese made my tummy and mouth happy.    My daughter had the Mac  & Cheese. The portion was HUGE!! Too bad they didn't have kid-size, but I was glad to bring some leftovers home. I had it for lunch the next day! My stressful day improved because of this dish. My daughter loved it too!   The four of us shared the Stinky Fries. Garlic and parmesan cheese together?? Oh heck yeah! It was a match made in heaven. I would order this again.   Everyone enjoyed the meal. The waitress was friendly and efficient. She was really sweet to my daughter who had to wait for her Mac & Cheese while everyone else had their food already. Maybe she felt bad because she put in her order late. It arrived quick, so I wouldn't have known she put it in late if she hadn't said anything.   Congratulations to Funny Farm for their new and improved location!!!","1. [Food quality]=However, the food was delicious!!! The food is still excellent! 2.

8,"Such a funky, fun, cool spot to grab a bite!  I came here on a whim as I was in the area and wanted to grab a bite in between meetings. It's tucked into the corner spot in between Wells Fargo & Pizza My Heart in a small plaza with ample parking spots.  When you come in, the door rattles which kinda surprised me but I upon entering and seeing the vibe of Funny Farm, it clicked (or clucked lol). Seating is a mish/mash of everything from booths, your standard kitchen chairs, and even love seats! The ceiling had slinkys \","1. [food]=No relevant information found. 2.

9,Had brunch at the Funny Farm. It's gonna be my new weekend breakfast favorite. It is an American cuisine restaurant. This restaurant has a laid back fun vibe to it. Family place. The food is filling and tastes great. Their dishes have a creative twists on the classics. The tator tots are done perfectly! The prices are similar to a little better than other local breakfast places. The service is excellent and our server Maureen was delightful and took care of all our needs. Clean setting. Indoor and outdoor seating.  Definitely check this place out and support a new local business,1. [food]=The food is filling and tastes great. Their dishes have a creative twists on the classics.

10,"The Funny Farm, AMAZINGLY delicious food and mouth watering drinks with great service and a casual atmosphere.   Great customer service from all employees. Walking in and we were greeted with a smile and then quickly seated. First time we came we got the special seats for 2 with the velvet high back seats, fun. This time around we were a larger group so we were seated at a regular table. The interior is fun with cool nooks and crannies for dining. They offer indoor and outdoor dining options.   Now the food, OMG, everything is definitely delicious and perfectly prepared and nicely presented. Portions are very generous and enough to share if you wanted to.   FOOD  What we ordered Get Shorty Mother Clucker The Burgereeto The Yardbird Stinky Fries Tater Tots Everything was so good we had to come back again and eat here, but, this time we had to bring the family so they to can enjoy the food here.  DRINKS  What we ordered Chocolate Martini  Michelada  The Sinful Sunset  The Peach Paloma  Oh and I cant forget the BLUE drink on the secret menu. Thank you and CHEERS Marvin for the amazing drinks you prepared for us and your friendly spirited hospitality. We will see you again in the near future.   I highly recommend you visit The Funny Farm for a fun and welcoming experience with great customer service. Your bellies will thank you for the delicious food and drinks. Disregard negative reviews and come experience it for yourself. Say patricia sent you, lol. Happy dining.","1.

11,"I came here for my birthday lunch/dinner cuz the food looked like comfort food and just looked really tasty and that I'd be in a food coma right after...but a happy food coma lol Now the waitress ELLIE was soo cool and made our visit there fun and absolutely enjoyable. Ellie's the homie lol They have a little bar inside which we ordered like 20 shots cuz it was happy hour:)and the restaurant itself is about medium size. It's comfortable. Now the food was very satisfying. I had their truffle burger which was THEEE BOMB and we ordered their short rib poutine which had my eyes rollin in the back of my head lol My aunt ordered some pasta which, from what I remembered, was pretty good and everyone ordered different burgers and they all loved their food. I don't remember what they ordered cuz I was pervin and swervin but i do fursholy remember the truffle shuffle and that poutine. Delicioso!! Would I come back there...HELL YEEEAA shooot That place is small and quirky and I love the food and am looking forward to exploring their menu. Great service, great food, great vibe.","1.

12,"Tried this place for the 1st time after seeing via Yelp.  It did not disappoint.   Very friendly staff = A service.   Delicious dishes.  We tried the poutine fries with gravy.  Truffle burger (no photo taken), Philly melt and bbq brisket melt.  All are very yummy in our tummies.   Enjoyed my experience and I can recommend to others.    Our server, Maureen (I believe that's her name) is super welcoming and friendly. Thank you.","1. [food]=Delicious dishes. We tried the poutine fries with gravy.

14,"A number of restaurants tried and failed to succeed this former Pasta Pomodoro. Looks like the Funny Farm has staying power! They have an intriguing brunch menu in addition to their made-for-adults burgers. Great quality food, ample portion and excellent service.  Speaking of service, I'd like to give a shout out to Shehraaz for his enthusiasm and attention. He really made our lunch memorable!","1.

16,"I never done dine-in here, but a couple of coworkers and I have gotten takeout from Funny Farm on multiple occasions.   When we call in to place orders, they are always kind, knowledgeable, and ready with suggestions, when asked. It does take a little longer to prepare orders here than at some other burger joints, but it's well worth the wait. I've never been disappointed by anything I have ordered and I always get an egg on my burger!  When we first started ordering from them, the space was a tiny hole-in-the-wall tucked into a sports bar. Now, they have their own restaurant near EVC! I'll let you know how the vibe is once I make it in there to do sit-down dining.","1.

19,"We have been to this location twice and love dining here! Our server Maureen was amazing, helpful and super attentive.   We highly recommend the short rib poutine with gravy and the UFO burger was huge.   The Peanutbutter pie is a great choice for dessert. Although they have large ice cream sundaes, homemade cookies and more.   The happy hour is 3-6pm $5 well drinks, $9 glass of wine and other specials. The drink selection is plentiful and Marvin the bartender made delicious cocktails.    Outdoor seating. Very clean restaurant and restrooms. The owners are extremely nice and hands on. We love the menu, food, drinks, service and ambiance...we will be back!","1. [Food]=We highly recommend the short rib poutine with gravy and the UFO burger was huge. 2.
